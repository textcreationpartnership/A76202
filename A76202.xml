            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

If but only those two suppositions were known to be (at least) uncertain, what should we do with all those Learned Writings that so subtilly Dispute of the order and number of Gods Decrees? and how should we esteem them? He that will reade the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confession, may see what thoughts the first Protestants had of the Controversies about Predestination, and how little of that doctrine did enter their Religion.</p>

Mens thoughts and words are a poor felicity. Applause is such an aery nourishment, that I see few thrive by: (though I must confess that in me, as well as in others▪ the unreasonable sin of pride is daily stirring, and convincing me by experience that it is mortified but in part.) O that I may have the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member of Christ, and then I can spare the vain glory of the world! <hi>Vera ibi gloria erit, ubi laudantis nec errore quisquam, nec adulatione laudabitur: Verus honor qui nulli negabitur digno; nulli deferetur indigno: sed nec ad eum ambiget ullus indignus, ubi nullus permittetur esse nisi dignus:</hi> saith <hi>Austin, de Civit.

And I must also desire that want of smooth and pleasing words may not be judged the want of truth. <hi>Enimvero dissoluti est pectoris in rebus seriis quaerere voluptatem, &amp; cum tibi sit ratio cum male se habentibus atque aegris, son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If it were (as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> intimates, I think) Gods accepting the Price, its worth the while to shew that to be Temporal and Transient, when Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> will have his accepting of man in Adoption to be immanent and eternal: But if you maintain Gods justifying act at Christs death (whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken or suffered) to be an immanent act, then it must be before Christs death, even eternal too.

For even whilst the Elect are unconverted, they are then actually justified and freed from all sinne by the death of Christ: and God so esteems of them as free, and having accepted of that satisfaction, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconciled to them. By this Justification we are freed from the guilt of our sinnes: and because that is done away, God in due time proceeds to give us the grace of sanctification to free us from sinnes corruption, still inherent in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 2. <hi>In foro conscientiae,</hi> in our own sense: which is but the Revelation and certain Declaration of Gods former secret act of accepting Christs Righteousness to our Justification.] So <hi>pag.</hi> 23. he speaks again of the same Justification <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> and saith, that all the sinnes of the Elect are actually pardoned, the Debt-Book crossed, the hand-writing cancelled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that this grand transaction between God and the Mediator Jesus Christ was concluded on and dispatcht in heaven long before we had any being either in nature or grace.] This phrase of [dispatching it in heaven] makes me conjecture that it will prove some immanent act which they call Justification at Christs death.

A Polemical Divine much used to Disputations, and thereby to the glory and Triumph of Victory, is, as it seems by this Learned man, in the same case. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> found him not work enough, and rather then he would want more, he makes to himself an adversary (for he saith, it is against Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) which here in the beginning he confesseth, makes not himself one, so much as by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of his Proposition, or an affirming the contrary. Could you finde never a man in the world to deal with, that affirmed that there may be new immanent acts in God? If you could, they had been fitter for you to take in hand: For its like, they would purposely have maintained that assertion with some shew of reason: If you could not; then your doctrine is so universally received, that I should think it should not need your Arguments now to support it: And then you may well conclude, as you do, that you have done little by this Dispute; if you have but laboriously maintained that which no man denies. But it seems to me it was some reasons <hi>ab homine,</hi> from the person of your chosen-seigned adversary, rather then from the cause that allured or impelled you to this encounter.</p>
               <p>As you well begin with some explication of your sense, so will I also: and the rather seeing I have little else to do. I desire the Reader therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this much of my thoughts about the subject in hand, before I proceed further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In generall,</hi> I am very strongly perswaded that it is one of the greatest sins that a great part of Pious Learned Divines are guilty of, that they audaciously adventure to dispute and determine unrevealed things; and above all others, about the Nature and Actions of the Incomprehensible God. And that this is <hi>The</hi> very thing that hath divided, weakned and ruined the Church, more then any one thing, except plain contempt of God: And that it is under the wounds of these overwise mens Learning, that the poor Church hath lain bleeding many hundred years. Our Contentions, Envyings, Hear-burnings, by perverse zeal, and much of all our warres and calamities, are long of this sinne in these men: That as the Romish Clergy are justly esteemed the greatest Schismaticks on earth, for their audacious and unmercifull additions to the Creed, making such a number of new Keys which heaven must be opened and shut by, which God never made: So are those zealous Learned men, the cruel dividers of the Church, by occasioning our contentions, that will with boldness pry into things unrevealed, and with consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and peremptoriness determine them, and then with long and subtil and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent arguings maintain them, and make them seem necessary to the peace of the Church, or the soundness of our faith. Scarce any one thing hath more fully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me the frailty and fearfull pravity of man, then this: To think, that so silly a worm should be no more acquainted with his own weakness, and the infinite distance between God and man; and should so confidently think that he knows
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135058:15"/> what he doth not know! yea and what he cannot know? yea and be angry with all the world that will not say, It's true; and will not believe that he knows what he pretends to know! If a man should perswade me that I know how many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are in heaven, or how many daies it will be till Christs coming to Judgement, one would think it were no hard matter for me to know that I do not know any such thing. But if I should perswade my self that I know it, and should expect that all others should believe that I know it, and would write Volumes to prove it, and count all those ignotant or erroneous that will not believe me, or that will not say they know it when they do not, as well as I, whether this were the part of a man awake and in his wits, let others judge. How much more beyond our reach is the unsearchable nature of God, further then he hath revealed himself in his Works and Word, which, alas, affordeth us but a glimpse of his backparts. Yea the wonder is yet greater that these same Learned Divines, when they are at a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> in their arguing, will plead mans ignorance and incapacity to put off their adversary and blame others for too bold enquiries and intrusions into Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: and most of our Reformers do speak hardly of the Schoolmen for it (and very deservedly) and yet will not see the guilt in themselves. No man speaks more against his own natural inclination in this then I do: I feel as great a desire to Know, and to pry into any thing that others have disputed, and as much natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall delight in the reading of the most audacious subtil Disputers, as others do. I was wont to say, I could get more out of <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Durandus,</hi> and such like in a day, then out of many Ancient Fathers, and later Treatisers, in a mone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h. But I finde that as desire to know was the beginning of our misery, so is it the continuance. Why do men fear themselves no more, in that which innocent <hi>Adam</hi> was undone by? I finde that this bait of knowing things unrevealed, doth but entice men into vain hopes, and labours, and self-deluding promises, and flatter men into a pleasant loss of time (and worse:) and in the end faileth all their expectations: and the Learned Disputers come off as <hi>Adam</hi> did, with Gods acknowledgement that he was like God in knowing good and evil (Ironically, as some Divines think; or expressing his unhappiness plainly, as others.) Those leaves of <hi>Bradwardine</hi> and <hi>Twiss Vind.</hi> and <hi>de scient. Med.</hi> &amp;c. which I was wont to reade with longing and delight, I confess I look on now with fear; and many Learned Schoolmen (specially on the first Book of the <hi>Sentences</hi>) I read, as I hear men swear or take Gods name lightly in their common talk; even s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I confess its usual with men that know little themselves, to think that others know as little, and to measure the knowledge of other men by their own: and so its possible I may undervalue the Learning of these men, because having none my self, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the largeness of their capacities, and sublimity of their speculations. However I am sure I am wiser and righter in one point then I was: For when I steeped my thoughts in their speculations, and was my self of the same express opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with one of the parties, I thought that I begun to grow somewhat wise my self; but now I know I was deceived, and it was my folly, and that I knew not what I thought I knew. And though I will be bolder to befool such a one as my self, then men of such sublime incomprehensible knowledge; yet its my opinion that they are but men; and what a man is though I do not yet fully know, yet I am daily both studying and trying: and experience which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Serpent hath beguiled us as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> by drawing us from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that is in Christ. Vain Philosophy hath been the bait to deceive the Church: And so we are judiciously broken in pieces and ruined; and have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our cost to know good and evil. I think there is no hope of the Churches recovery but by returning to the primitive Christian simplicity; and using <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> as a help in Naturals, but not preferring him before Christ in the teaching of the highest speculations of Theology, as if we must go learn Gods nature of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> where Christ leaveth us at a loss. When those Learned men, who professing themselves wise became—shall become fools that they may be wise, and come quite back again to their <hi>cognosce teipsum,</hi> then they may know more of God then they yet do, and yet perceive that they know less then they thought they had known: and then their knowledge will edifie which now puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I think that man can have no positive proper corception of God, at least besides <hi>ens</hi> (which the Scotists think proper) and that there is no word in humane language that can express Gods nature in strict propriety, but all our notions of him are so exceeding imperfect, that they express more of our ignorance then of our knowledge. <hi>White</hi> is bold to say (<hi>Institut.

Yet as Scripture speaks of God in terms improper, according to mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and fetcht from mans nature and acts, so must we both conceive and speak: that is, not believing that these are proper expressions or conceptions of God, but that there is that in God which we cannot now more fitly conceive of then under these notions, or fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yet these attributions of Knowledge and Will, to God, are not false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, for there is really somewhat in God which these are made the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expressions of.

               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="9">9. Yet no doubt, the thing meant by Knowledge and Will when attributed to God, is not only, as many say, most eminently in God, but is solely in God; that which is called knowledge and will in man being not the same thing, but <hi>toto genere diversum.</hi> But yet the conception that we have of Gods Knowledge and Will is but improper derived from the supposed <hi>simile, viz.</hi> our own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and will, which representeth it with exceeding imperfection. So that the terms of Knowledge, Will, Decree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are spoken first and properly

Yet I acknowledge that though all these terms of Attribution, as to God, are exceeding improper, yet there are degrees of impropriety; some being more improper then others are: And so I doubt not but that the terms that are taken from humane passions and imperfections are more improperly applied to God, then these forementioned of Understanding and Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As I acknowledge no certainty of a proper Act in God, so I acknowledge no positive termination of that which in him we call an Act; and we call it immanent but in that negative sense which the later clause of your description doth express.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. YOu need not argue me to a higher respect to Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> then I have ever manifested, except you would have me say, He was a God, or an Angel, or an Infallible man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you cannot forbear, as you say, its pity you should be hindered: Men and women must speak when their list is so great. Who can hold that which will away?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I confess that I did not much consult mine Honour in that writing. Else you had not found your self work as you have done in these leaves. If you mean the Honour of my Honesty, your proof must do more to the determination then your assertion: If you mean the Honour of my Learning, do not you know well enough, how little I have to consult? He that hath nothing, hath nothing to lose.</p>
               <p n="4">4. [Sleightingly] is a word that will stretch, and therefore I will not charge you with untruth. In one mans sense, he sleights a man that cals him [that famous excellent Divine:] but in another mans, sleighting sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the esteeming of a man below his worth, and expressing so much, or setting light by a man. I am miserably troubled with those kinde of people that cannot endure [sleighting] as they call it, above all folks in the world. (I use to call them plainly, Proud people, here in the Countrey; but if I were to talk to Learned men I would use more manners.) They think I sleight them, if I do not applaud them, or complement with them, or if I commend them not with so loud a voice as they expect (and they are a people that are never low in their expectations:) or if I do but praise another above them, or speak to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before them, or be short with them (when I am busie) when they look for a longer more respectfull discourse; yea if my Hat should be over mine eyes that I see them not, or my memory so fail me as that I forget them; these and abundance more I am guilty of sleighting every day, that I am now grown accustomed to the vice, and shameless in hearing it charged upon me. But I suspect that my sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> consisteth in my supposing him to erre, and telling the world so: that is, in taking him to be a man: for <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Lay this with the commanded Adoration of the footsteps, and it seems, it is high matters indeed that you expect. I doubt, by this, that you will say, I slight <hi>you</hi> before I have done, either because I praise you not enough, or because I take you not for infallible and indefectible, or because I value Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> or Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> so very, very, very farre before you; when yet I am accused of slighting them.

I profess still most highly to love and reverence the names of these two blessed excellent men, as formerly I never honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any two men more. For Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> I am more beholden to his Writings for that little knowledge I have then almost any one mans, besides: and for Mr. <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> for ought I can see in his Book of Justification, he revoked this same errour which in his <hi>Vindic.

               <p>This much I take my self bound to publish for a common warning. And I would further advise all to take heed how they entertain Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi>▪s doctrine about the cause of sin; of which I shall be ready to give my reason when I have a call; but will not now digress so far.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For your good wish [that my Books had not something in the Doctrinal part not answering the devotional] I thank you. But, alas, ignorance and errour will not be healed with a wish: Many a year have I studied and praied against them, and yet they stick by me still. But had I erred in the Foundation, it would have spoiled my Devotion: for <hi>non recte vivitur, ubi de Deo non bene creditur:</hi> And I had rather be defective in lesser doctrinals, then in Devotion. And though I am as confident that you erre in some of your Doctrinals (as I shall anon mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135058:18"/> as you are of my erring, yet I heartily wish your Devotion be as good as your Judgement in Doctrine; and I think I wish you a greater blessing then you wished me.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I do not well relish your exceeding coldness in Gods cause, who are so hot for man: When it is for the honour of your Learned Brethren, [you have not patience, you cannot forbear.] But what Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> hath said for Justification from Eternity, on the ground that there is no new immanent act in God, this you say, <hi>Matters not:</hi> Is it a phrase beseeming a Preacher of Christs Truth to say, [<hi>It matters not?</hi>] When that Truth is contradicted in so high a Point? and the souls of men, and the peace of the Church so much endangered? A <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llio</hi> might better have spoke thus. <hi>England</hi> hath not sped so well by the Antinomians of late, as that any knowing friend of it, should say, It matters not, when such great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines promote their cause.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And where you also say, that [it matters not what some in the Synod said against him, and how little he said for himself.] I am not of your minde. 1. Is it only the <hi>vestigia Doctoris Twissi &amp; M. K.</hi> that are to be adored? You shall give me leave to honour you much, and the Doctor more, but the Assembly more then either of you. 2. I do not think the Doctor was so weak, or at least a good cause so friendless in the Assembly, but that himself or some other would have done something considerable to the justification of his cause, if it had been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable. 3. I will be bold to ask you, the next time I see you, whether all your heat and impatience for unworthy handling or slighting the Doctor be not meant against the Assembly as well as me? or if not, Whether it be not respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that made the difference? or rather the securing of your reputation, which you might think would be elevated by a Victory over others, or at least lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though the person were so contemptible, as not to adde to your glory; but by an opposition to the Assembly it might have been dasht in pieces? Or if the Antinomians being questioned by the Assembly shall alleadge Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi>'s words (frequently and plainly uttered) for their Defence; and the Doctors cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon questioned shall fall without any justification; I pray you tell me, Whether there may not be the same necessity for <hi>us</hi> to take notice of his Errours as the Assembly? and whether after them we may not do it (while we honour his worth as much as I still do) without slighting or wronging him. It is more dishonour to be Questioned by an Assembly and come off unjustified, then to be judged to mistake by so contemptible a person as I.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where you speak of [his very Name doing most of the service.] I do not understand what service you mean. I know you mean not the service done in his Writings: And sure you dare not mean [the service done by the Assembly:] for that were to make them a contemptible Assembly indeed, if a mans Name, yea <hi>magni nominis umbra,</hi> did most of their service: And it were to think as basely of their service as the worst Sectary doth, that I have met with. It were not worth so much cost, and so many years pains, nor worthy the Acceptation of Parliament or People, if it were but the offspring of Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi>'s Name. But Sir we have received fruits that shew they came from another cause then a name or the shadow of a name. I confess I value their least Catechism for children above all Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi>'s learned Labours, were they twenty times more of the same quality. I never heard but one Learned man speak contemptuously of the Assembly, and his friends say it was because he was not thought Worthy to be one of them (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those that were against them in the Warre; where heat of opposition might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135058:18"/> occasion disesteem: But if this were Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s case, yet methinks when he changed his Cause and Party, he should withall have changed his esteem of the Assembly.) But its likely that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> means that it was the Doctors Name that did most of the service of a Moderator; most of his own part in the Assembly: It may be so: But if he had nothing to work by but his Name, yet had his cause been good, it would in that Assembly have found some friends. But what you mean then by the following words, I do not well know, that his Name you are sure [was that formidable thing to the Learned adversary.] Perhaps you mean your self, by the Learned adversary, of whose fears I confess you might be sure, and so might know the Name or Word that did affright you: else I cannot imagine who you mean, except it were the Kings party or the Episcopal Divines together: But for Episcopacy, I know of no Disputes that ever the Assembly had upon it, and so had no adversaries in a disputing way; at least during Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi>'s time. And for disputing the Kings Cause, I think they did as little in it. Some chosen men in the Treaties indeed disputed against Episcopacy, but with other weapons then Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi>'s Name. If you should mean that it was Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi>'s Name that made the Learned Episcopal Divines have Reverend thoughts of the Assembly, I must tell you that there were in that Assembly no small number of Divines of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency for Learning, Piety and Ministerial Ability, which might command Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence from the Learnedest adversaries of you all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But though his Name did all the service; yet you [question not but he could have easily made it good, That there is no new immanent act in God, against, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] It seems by this that you think this the easier to prove of the two: And indeed I am acquainted with none that are minded to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nor is it reasonable for you to say, that you [would fain have any of them all that opposed him, to give a satisfactory answer to your Argument,] when you know it was not in that Point that they opposed him. Would you make more your adversaaies against their will as well as me? or do you long for more honourable Antagonists to cope with? And whats your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> REmember that I say not that your Doctrine is <hi>Untrue,</hi> but <hi>Uncertain.</hi> It may be possibly as you say; but whether you can tell that it is so, or prove it to be so, I doubt. To your great Argument, I expect better proof of your <hi>major</hi> Proposition, which indeed hath none at all. Two things I expected you should have proved: 1. That God hath an Understanding and Will which act; properly so called: or that you know what it is that is improperly called Gods Understanding and Will? 2. That God hath no immanent Act but of his Understanding or Will. To begin with the last: I will not say, <hi>datur tertium.</hi> For I dare not say properly <hi>dantur duo:</hi> But I will desire you to prove your <hi>major:</hi> and I think that in the same sense as God is said to have an Understanding and Will, for ought you know he may have other acts, which those two notions will not express. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or 1. You are uncertain whether Angels may not have other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or acts-immanent, besides Understanding and Will: (If you say, you are sure they have not, prove it:) and so others may be ascribed to God by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy from them, as these be by Analogy from man. You know perhaps how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny senses you have your self: but how can you prove that no other creature hath a sixth sense, which you are uncapable of knowing the name or nature of? So how know you but Angels may have powers or immanent acts beside Understanding and Willing, which you know nothing of for name or nature? Must all Gods superiour creatures be needs measured by poor man? How much more noble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hath God, then these below that dwell in dust! 2. But if you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the Angels in heaven, and were at a certainty about the number or nature of their powers or acts, how prove you that God hath no other act then what Understanding and Willing doth express? That one unconceivable perfect act in God, which <hi>Eminenter</hi> (by an unconceivable transcendent eminence) is <hi>Understanding and Willing,</hi> (yet but Analogically so called) but properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally is neither, but somewhat more excellent; is in all likelihood very restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly or defectively expressed by these two words; even as to the objective extent. How know we but that in some of Gods creatures, or at least in God himself there may be something found besides Entity, Verity, Goodness; or any thing that is the object of Intellection or Volition, whereof no man had ever any concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However, is it not unlikely, yea a dangerous imagination, That the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or acts of such wretched worms as we, should be so farre commensurable with the Infinite Majesty, that as we have no immanent act but of Understanding or Will (or subordinate to these) so God hath no other? or none but what are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these two notions! Alas, that silly worms should so unreverently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume! and pretend to that knowledge of God which they have not! and might so easily know that they have not!</p>
               <p>And for the former, How farre God hath an Understanding or Will, I will peruse your words to Master <hi>Goodwin</hi> when I have done with this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>This were enough to your Argument and Challenge: but I proceed to the confirmation of your implied <hi>minor.</hi> And 1. I easily grant you, that it is certain there is no Addition to, or mutation of Gods Essence. 2. I think all the Acts as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God are his Essence, and are one in themselves considered. Pardon▪ that I do but say [I think:] For though principles of reason and Metaphysical Axioms
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135058:19"/> seem to lead plainly to this Conclusion; yet I am afraid of pretending to any greater Certainty then I have; or of building too much on the doubtfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of mans slippery Reasonings, about the nature of the Invisible Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible God. I think it most sutable to Gods Unity and Simplicity, that all his immanent acts (so called by us) are Himself and are One. But I dare not say I am certain that God cannot be Simple and Perfect, except this be true: both because He is beyond my knowledge, and because the doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity assureth us that there is in God a true diversity▪ consisting with Unity, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Perfection of Essence. 3. You know not what the subject of your Proposition is, (Gods acts of Understanding and Will:) and therefore you are uncapable of such peremptory concluding <hi>de Modis,</hi> knowingly and certainly, as here you pretend to. 4. You cannot prove that there's any such thing in God as an Immanent Act, or an Understanding or a Will in proper sense: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there is which we cannot fitlier or more profitably conceive or express then under such notions, drawn Analogically from mans acts of Understanding and Willing. Now if we will speak of Gods Incomprehensible nature by such Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and put the names of Understanding and Willing on God, as borrowed from mans understanding and willing, then must we accordingly conceive of Gods understanding and willing, as like to mans in the form of these acts (for we can reach to no higher conceptions, though these be utterly improper.) Now mans actual intellection doth connote and suppose an intelligible object, and his Will doth connote and suppose an appetible object: and consequently it cannot be expected according to the utmost imaginable natural perfection of them, that either should go beyond the extent of their objects, or be such acts without their proper objects: <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135058:20"/> be Past: but knows things truly as they be. 2. This being premised, they will then assume, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did not actually exist from eternity: Christ did not actually suffer from eternity: and so the actual existence of <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>nunc temporis,</hi> was not an intelligible object from Eternity: and therefore they think they may conclude, that it could not be known from Eternity. They will urge their reason thus: 1. There was no Time from Eternity (that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time:) therefore it could not be intelligible, that <hi>Peter</hi> did actually then exist in Time. 2. Else you will confound Futurition and Present existence: God did know from Eternity▪ that <hi>Peter</hi> would exist in Time, <hi>i. e. futuritionem Petri:</hi> therefore it was not <hi>Peter</hi>'s present actual existence that he knew. 3. The nature of <hi>foreknowledge</hi> is to know things as future, and therefore must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with knowledge of things as existent. 4. This proposition before the creation was not true [<hi>Peter</hi> doth actually exist:] therefore God could not know it to be then true. But after <hi>Peter</hi>'s birth it did <hi>de novo</hi> become a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: and therefore must be <hi>de novo</hi> known to be then true. Before that, it was only true that [<hi>Haec Propositio vera futura est</hi>] but not [<hi>vera est:</hi>] therefore no more but the futurition of the Truth could be known, and not the actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent existence (as referring to time:) It is not all one to say [<hi>Petrus erit</hi>] and [<hi>Petrus est</hi>] nor all one to know it. 5. The contradictory Proposition was then true [<hi>Peter</hi> doth not exist:] But both contradictory Propositions could not be known to be true together, that is from Eternity. Therefore God did then know the Negative Proposition as then true [<hi>Petrus non existit:</hi>] and the Affirmative <hi>de futuro</hi> to be true [<hi>Petrus futurus est, vel existet:</hi>] but he did not know the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative <hi>de existentia praesenti</hi> to be true from Eternity [<hi>Petrus in nunc temporis existit</hi>] no nor [<hi>Petrus in nunc Aeternitatis existit:</hi>] for they were then false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: nor yet was it then true that [<hi>Tempus actu existit.</hi>] If you say, That there were no Propositions from Eternity, and therefore they could not be true or false: this alters not the case: for 1. We speak on supposition that there had been creatures to have framed these Propositions. 2. If we conceive not of Gods Understanding as knowing the truth of Propositions, concerning things, we shall scarce have any conception of it as an Understanding at all. 3. The Schools commonly speak of the Eternal truth of Propositions, <hi>e. g. de futuris contingenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> 4. There are Propositions in Time, and these God knows: and thats all one to the present case. At <hi>Noahs</hi>

               <p>But then I would fain know whether there be not the same necessity that the difference between objects [only future] and [presently existent] should cause our understandings to put the forementioned various denominations on Gods Knowledge, as the difference <hi>inter Possibilia &amp; Futura,</hi> doth so cause us to put on it? And also whether in the same impropriety and imperfection, the very notions of [Understanding, Willing, Acting, Immanently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] be not <hi>Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationes ab intellectu nostro impositae,</hi> or assumed by God in condescension to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weakness, expressing but some little, very little, of that Divine—I know not what. For that same thing which man hath a true formall conception of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of [Knowing, Willing] is varied according to the variety of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135058:21"/> objects: But if it be not so with God (as I must think and say, It is not, if I presume to think and say any thing of it,) that is because Knowledge and Willing in Him are not the things that we by those terms use to express; nor yet any thing that we can have formall proper conceptions of: And by the same necessity and warrant as we do bring down the Divine nature so low, as to apply to it the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Acting, Understanding, Willing; may we also apply to it the notions of Acting, Knowing and Willing <hi>de novo;</hi> confessing a further addition to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of speech. And therefore as God himself doth in Scripture accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himself to our capacity, by assuming the terms and notions of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Willing, so doth he also of loving where he before hated, with divers the like, which in man would imply an innocent muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I have here given you some reason of several passages of mine, which your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pages carp at, before you discerned my meaning, as I shall shew you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anon.</p>
               <p>So much to your proof that there is no new immanent act in Gods Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. One word to what follows about his Will.</p>
               <p>Where you argue thus: [<hi>If of his Will, then this new act is either for the Better, or Worse, or Indifferent,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Ans.</hi> In strict propriety, it is taken as unproved, that he hath Will, or Immanent acts. But <hi>ad captum humanum</hi> as we are necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to ascribe Willing and Acting to him, so they that think they may on the same grounds ascribe New acts of Will to him (as the Scripture undoubtedly doth,) will think that your Argument is sufficiently answered thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. This arguing supposeth mans silly intellect capable of comprehending the Reasons of the Acts of the Almighty; as if it cannot be, except we can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the reason of it, and whether it be for the better or worse or indifferent; or what it produceth, or to what end it is: which is a most bold arrogant presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in such moles as we are. As I said before, you know not whether there may not be more Affections or <hi>Modi entium</hi> open to the Divine Intellect and Will, or Nature, then we have any name for or conception of: And though mans will look only at the goodness or appetibility or conveniency of objects, yet you know not what Gods will is; and therefore know not what is its adequate object. Many other reasons also of the obscurity of this might be given.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be answered you, that the said New act of Gods will, is for the Better: But then they will distinguish of [<hi>Better.</hi>] 1. They will say, It is Better <hi>quoad rerum ordinem:</hi> and it is Better to the creature: (as for God to love him that before he hated: or approve of him, whom before he disapproved.) 2. They distinguish also between that which may be said to be Better to God himself: Either Really, by a real addition to his perfection; and so nothing can be Better to God: Or 2. Relatively and Reputatively; as God is said to be Blessed, Glorified, Honoured, Well pleased, Exalted, Magnified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus it may be Better to God, though he receive no real addition of felicity; and so not Vain or Indifferent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They will desire you to Answer your own Argument as to transient Acts, and they think it may serve as to immanent acts. (Remembring that they suppose that there be new acts in God without mutation; because they suppose that those very things that we call immanent Acts in him are but denominations of his sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essence, according to the various aspects or respects of the objects, which make no more mutation then relations do.) Was Gods act of Creation, of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135058:21"/> Christ from death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Better, or Worse, or Indifferent? I think you will say as before, that it was not Better as to God in the adding of any real felicity to him: But to God Reputarively and Relatively, and to the creature really, it was Better. So will they say about immanent acts, which may perfect the whole (as the Honour of the Prince is the good of the Commonwealth) and may be necessary to the Good of particular persons; and the reputative Good of God himself. Its said, God made All things for himself, Was it for Better to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or Worse, or Indifferent?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it Better or Worse for a looking Glass that it receive a hundred various <hi>species de novo?</hi> You will perhaps say, It is no disparagement to the Glass to be receptive of new <hi>species</hi> without being made Better or Worse: as also that its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is passive, and so is not Gods Understanding or Willing. I know not what it is: but I confess i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must needs be a very improper conception to conceive of God as passive in knowing. And yet man hath no true apprehension of a knowledge which is wholly <hi>sine passione:</hi> But how prove you that God cannot, if he please, by his active Knowledge, Know <hi>de novo,</hi> without becoming Better or Worse? or doing it in vain? Are you sure that every new act of intellection (even in a dream) doth make mans understanding better or worse? or else is vain? I confess more may be here said.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Having done with your Argument, they will further tell you, that, If God may have new relations without any real change, then, for ought you know, he may have new immanent acts without a real change: But the Antecedent is unquestionably true: (God was not a Creator before he had creatures: nor is he our Father before we are his children; nor our King, Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before we are his subjects, servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except <hi>de jure</hi> only:) The Consequence they prove thus: Relations have as true an Entity, as, for ought you know, these which we call Immanent Acts in God, may have: Therefore the Novation of them will make as great a change. Here they suppose that <hi>Actio</hi> and <hi>Relatio</hi> are both acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (taken properly) and neither of them meer <hi>Entia Rationis</hi> (for in so think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they go in the more beaten road) much less nothing: Or if you will say, that <hi>Relatio</hi> is but <hi>Modus entis,</hi> they will say so of action too: Or however they tell you, that it may be so for ought you know, with that which we call an Act in God. And here they suppose that his Acts are not his Essence absolutely and in it self considered; and that it signifies not all one to say, God is God, and to say, God willeth the existence of this worm: And therefore they will say, that these which we call Acts, may be, if not Relations, yet some of <hi>Scotus</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, or something to us unknown, which have either no more Being then Relations, or at least not so much as to make a real change in God. And that there is in his simple, indivisible Essence, a Trinity of persons, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: so there may be in his Essence, distinct formalities (or somewhat that we cannot name or conceive of) of a lower nature, then Personality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inconvenience: and as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his will be more spoke to anon, when we come to your doctrine of transient Acts. They say, A transient act is not a meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135058:22"/> or Passion or Effect: But there is in it that which may be called action <hi>

                     </gap> agente,</hi> as well as passion <hi>à patiente.</hi> Now if <hi>actio</hi> be <hi>efficientis actio</hi> here, and God in creating the world did <hi>verè agere,</hi> then either the world was created from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or else God did create it from Eternity, and yet it was created only in Time, and the Causation or Causing creating Act was infinitely before the Effect; or else there was a new act really performed by God in Time. The first none will maintain, that I deal with. The second, say they, is against common reason: For Gods act is the <hi>Causa proxima creaturae;</hi> and <hi>omnis causa proxima reciprocatur cum suo effectu:</hi> i. e. <hi>Posita causa proxima in actu, necesse est effectum poni:</hi> If it be <hi>causa totalis,</hi> yea and requireth nothing else to the effect so much as by preparation, or disposition, no nor a subject matter, then the act of creation must needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly produce the creature; and the <hi>Creare</hi> and <hi>Creari</hi> must needs be insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Its answered that Gods creating act was from eternity, but the effect, or creature, was not till its Time. But it will be replied, That either God did more for the creatures production or creation at the time of its passive creation, then he did from Eternity, or he did no more: If more, then he did something <hi>de novo:</hi> If no more, then either the creature would have had its Being from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>quia posita causâ ponitur effectus;</hi> or else if you ask whats the reason that the creature was not in Being sooner or later, no cause can be assigned▪ and so God should not be the cause. This holds equally (say they) whether you make the creating act to be only Gods <hi>Velle,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> superadded execution of that will, as being the effect of power. For either God willed the creatures present existence from eternity, as much as at the time of its creation, or as at this day▪ or he did not. If he did not, then he willeth <hi>de novo:</hi> If he did, then the creature would have existed, as soon as it was willed. To say, that God willed from Eternity that the creature should be in Time, is true: But is it as much to Will that it <hi>shall be,</hi> as to Will its present existence? If it be answered, That there is no <hi>Past</hi> or <hi>Future</hi> with God; I answer 1. That this was prevented before; when it was said, that God understandeth Time, and propositions concerning time, though time be only mans measure, and propositions mans instruments. 2. The men that I speak to, maintain that all things coexist not with God from Eternity (though indeed the term [<hi>from</hi>] as here used, contradicteth Eternity:) and they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Gods willing <hi>rerum futuritionem &amp; existentiam praesentem:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this seemeth to make against their answer. (But indeed none of all this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is solid, because of the different manner of producing effects <hi>per voluntatem, &amp; per potentiam excquentem voluntati superadditam.</hi>) Perhaps it will be said, that if all this be granted, yet it followeth not that immanent acts may be <hi>de novo</hi> without a change in God, because the Creating act, or any transient act is so: For the former is God himself, but the later is not. To which it may be replied, 1. We speak not now of a product or effect, called the Creation, but of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting act and then why should not that be God himself, as well as an immanent act? If you say it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Accidents God hath none: Substance it cannot be; except it be God. If you say it is any <hi>modus,</hi> you know what School contradiction you must expect: Or if you say it is a Reality or a Formality, those that you deal with will tell you, that they can as well prove the immanent acts to be formalities, or such like, as you can the transient.

And you well know how commonly it is maintained that <hi>Deus operatur per essentiam:</hi> and that there is no act but his essence it self, requisite to any effect, which he produceth, as it is the effect of the first Cause. But this is but <hi>ad hominem;</hi> for these are not their principles whose arguings I now recite. They suppose that creation and other transient acts, are not meer Volitions, but acts of power, in execution of Gods will. To which purpose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow largely many famous Schoolmen have argued, is obvious to them that are conversant in them. <hi>Aurcolus</hi> hath fifteen Arguments to this end. <hi>Gregor. Arminiensis</hi> hath many Arguments to prove that how ever Creation or Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be taken, neither of them is God himself. <hi>Capreolus</hi> I know and other Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists answer these Arguments: and much may be replied and is, to those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers: so that in so dark and unsearchable a Controversie, strong wits may finde something to say, against each other, longer then the patience of the wisest of their Readers will hold out to know the issue of their disputes. <hi>Aegidius, Thom. de Argent. Occam,</hi> and others plead also for a necessity of an executive act of power, distinct from the meer act of willing, or that Creation is not God. So do <hi>Jacob. Martini, Suarez, Schibler,</hi> and other later Authors. And if (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith) transient acts be <hi>formaliter in agente,</hi> as well as immanent, then the inception of new immanent acts seems to have no other inconveniences, then the inception of transient acts as to the form. But indeed the Thomists say the same of both, that they are only Gods essence, and that God hath no transient act at all, but only that his Essence or Will or Understanding may be so denominated for the rational Relation of the Object thereto. And therefore <hi>Aquinas (1. q. 25. a.</hi> 1.) maintaining that there is in God <hi>Potentia activa</hi> (though not <hi>passiva</hi>) withall maintains it to be the samething, as the action, and as his Will and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (And yet sometime be calleth Gods actions transient! but in this he speaks unconstantly or doubtfully, as <hi>Suarez</hi> noteth <hi>Met. disp.</hi> 20. §. 5.) And the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all <hi>Capreolus</hi> answer to <hi>Aureolus</hi> fifteen Arguments is this same distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between Gods act of Creation it self (which is his Will and Essence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and eternal) and the <hi>Relatio rationis</hi> between God and the object; from which Gods will is denominated a transient act. But yet in this transient act, it is only the relation, and not the act it self (which is God himself) which may be diversified or renewed. Now if this meer <hi>relatio rationis</hi> be sufficient ground for our denomination of Gods act to be [Transient] and these transient acts to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135058:23"/> be new, then it may seem that the relation of the same act to some extrinsick terminative objects (as of Gods knowledge to the present existence of things <hi>in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nc temporis</hi>) doth give the same ground to call those acts new, though not so properly transient. For if one may be denominated from its respect to its object, why not the other: Nay why the same <hi>relatio rationis</hi> may not as well denominate those acts transient also, which we now call immanent, is not easie to discern: For both have respect to an extrinsick object, if that suffice. Nay doth not that act which is called immanent, produce or effect? seeing it is only <hi>Volendo</hi> without any other executive action that God effecteth all things that are effected: and this <hi>Vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> from eternity is (say they) <hi>causa in actu</hi> of those things that are produced in time. And therefore many say, that God hath no Will as to extrinsicks, but what is effective: and so that his Will hath no extrinsick object properly so called, but only products or effects. That <hi>omne velle Dei est operativum &amp; efficax eorum quae vult,</hi> and that therefore he may not be said to will any thing but what he doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. See <hi>Gibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that in Conclusion, according to the Doctrine of the most Learned Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, there is in God neither immanent nor transient act in M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>K</hi>'s sense. (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those that are terminated, as they call it, in himself as the object.) Not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; for they are not terminated in the Agent, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>K.</hi> saith, such are; nay they have respect to things extrinsick; nay, say many, they are productive of these extrinsick things. Not transient; for Gods essence doth not <hi>transire in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum extraneum,</hi> but only cause it without any other executive action; and so respecteth it. In the same sense therefore, and on the same grounds as you will maintain the transient act to be in time, and not eternal, will these men think to prove it also of the immanent. For even the transient acts of God (so called) are not in the creature, but only respect and effect them. As <hi>Capreolus</hi> saith (<hi>li. 2. dist. 1. q. 2. art. 3.) Talis actio praedicamentalis &amp; quae est motus, est subjectivè in passo: Divina autem actio non est motus, nec mutatio, licet causet motum &amp; muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.</hi>

But they much insist on that before intimated, that if it be no wrong to Gods simplicity to have diversity or multiplicity of immanent acts ascribed to him, then it is not any wrong to his immutability to have such acts ascribed to him <hi>de novo:</hi> For the reason will prove alike. But that it is no wrong to God to have diversity of immanent acts ascribed to him, is evident by 1. The use of Scripture. 2. The use of all Divines. 3. And the necessity of the thing. 1.

Its easie to say, that all these are one and the same thing: and the same is not before or after it self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this is not taken for a satisfactory
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135058:23"/> way of disputing. 3. Yea is it not apparent, that there is a necessity of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing language? How many souls would you be likely to convert, and save? how many sins to prevent, by telling your Auditory, that in deed and truth it is all one thing in God to Decree a man to salvation, or to decree him to damnation? Its all one to Will that you shall sin, and that you shall not sin: that you shall die this day, and that your Neighbour shall live fourty years longer: Its the same thing, without any true difference, for God to Love you now you believe, and to Hate you while you were a worker of Iniquity; to be pleased and displeased, to Approve and dislike; His Love to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Hatred to <hi>Judas,</hi> to <hi>Esau</hi> was the same thing, only the effects are not the same. I say, how savoury and profitable would this doctrine be?</p>
               <p>And are there not the same Reasons for our ascribing to God, the beginning and ending of Immanent Acts, as the Diversity of them? Is not one as consistent with his Immutability, as the other with his simplicity? Doth not Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to God the Inception and ending of Immanent Acts, as well as the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of them? And is ther enot as great a necessity of our using that language as the other? How many souls were you like to save by telling them [God Loved you as well before you believed, yea before Christ died for you, as he doth since! God doth Hate you now as much as he did when you were a worker of iniquity, and is as much offended with you since you believed as he was when you were a childe of wrath! He had the same thoughts of you when you were blaspheming, murdering and committing adultery, as when you repent and pray. God is now decreeing to create the world; he is now decreeing to give the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> to save <hi>Noah</hi> by the Ark, <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> he is now Decreeing that Christ shall suffer for us; he now knows all these as future: he is no more Reconciled to the world by Christ, or Pleased in or by his Sufferings and Merits then he was before: God knows now that [Christ is now on the Cross] or [Christ is not Risen] is a true Proposition, because he did once know that it is a true Proposition: and he ceaseth not to know it:] would this kinde of doctrine seem sound and edifying? Do you use to preach thus?</p>
               <p>But you'le say, That Gods Knowledge, Will, Power, Goodness, Justice, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness, his Willing the End and the Means, the futurition of things, and their present existence, mens salvation or damnation are all diversified onely as to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick denomination,</hi> and not really: from the variety of objects it is, that one act of God is variously denominated.</p>

But <hi>Scotus</hi> with his followers, <hi>Sirectus, Basolis, Trombeta le Roy, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thutius, Mayro, Faventinus,</hi> and the like, tell us of more then extrinsick denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And if there be in God a Diversity of Formalities; it may as well be said, that there is an inception and ending of these Formalities in him.

The describers of Extrinsick Denomination that place it between <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Nihil,</hi> make it to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the order of a thing to the subject which yet it is not in.

                  </gap>ing <hi>Peter</hi> to life, and <hi>Judas</hi> to death; his loving <hi>Jacob</hi> and hating <hi>Esau,</hi> are all one; his knowing one thing to be future, and another not future, is all one: But yet because of the Diversity of objects it is meet and needfull, that we Denominate extrinsecally Gods acts to be divers: and so to distinguish his Intention of the End, from his Election of the Means; his Election from his Reprobation, his Approbation from his dislike, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even so, these acts in God have in themselves no Beginning or End: God did never Begin to Love, to Will this or that, to Know <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet because of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Ending of objects, it is meet and needfull to Denominate Gods acts extrinsecally as Beginning and Ending, as the objects do, and changing with them. For here the case is the same as to Gods Immutability, as in the other to his simplicity. And if this hold, then those men that should write Voluminous Disputes, about the Beginning and Ending of Immanent acts, would do as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably as D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Twiss</hi> and others do in writing so of their diversity, priority and posteriority in nature. Nay is it not much more Justifiable then many of their Volumes? For from Eternity there was no reall diversity of objects to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gods Immanent acts from. For that <hi>esse cognitum vel volitum,</hi> which they'le flie to, could be no where, but <hi>in mente &amp; voluntate Divina:</hi> and if there were no Diversity <hi>in mente Divina</hi> at all, then what ground can be imagined of the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Denominations? For example, <hi>Possibilia &amp; futura</hi> being nothing, could not in themselves differ from eternity: Yet how great a fabrick doth D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Twiss</hi> build upon this Proposition, that [the transition of things future <hi>è numero possibil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>um in numerum futurorum,</hi> being from Eternity, it must needs have an eternal Cause which can be no other then Gods Will.] Now if there were no such transition, but <hi>in mente divinâ,</hi> and if there were no such notion from Eternity any where else, as is [Future and Possible] and so it must be imagined to be an <hi>Ens raetionis Divinae,</hi> then it plainly follows that there was no such thing as Future, distinct from Possible: for in God is no distinct Immanent acts, (as knowing Possibles, and Knowing things future;) and in the things was no distinction, for they are nothing.</p>
               <p>It seems therefore that upon your own Grounds it is as Justifiable and necessary, to Denominate extrinsecally Gods Immanent acts, as having Beginning and End, when the objects have so, as it is to Denominate them divers from the diversity of the object: and that if we made this our ordinary speech in voluminous Disputes, you could no more blame us for it, then all the exactest School-Divines are to be blamed for the other.</p>
               <p>Moreover, some may think, that you do teach Infidels to destroy the Christian Faith, or teach a man to prove or disprove what he will, because Contradictories may consist, <hi>e. g.</hi> If they would prove that [Christ is not Risen] thus: That which God knoweth to be true, is true: But God Knoweth this Proposition to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue [Christ is not Risen] Therefore. The <hi>minor</hi> they prove thus: God did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135058:24"/> once know this Proposition to be true: Therefore he doth so still: for there is no Ending of any Immanent act of God. It will be answered, That this onely shews a difference in the object, that it was once true, which now is not: but Gods act is the same by which he knoweth these mutable objects. Be it so: (yet whether it be certain and can be proved still, is by them doubted:) but is it fit for us to speak of this act as one only? It seems then, it is all one, in God to know a Proposition to be True, and to know it to be false. For the fore-said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position [Christ is not Risen] was True one day, and False the next; and God knew both. You'le say, It is all one in God to Know that to be True which is True, and that to be False which is False: but in both he knows <hi>Verè, etsi non verum.</hi> But then you must tell us further, what it is for God to Know [<hi>Truly:</hi>] Is it the Congruency of his Knowledge to the Object, which we call the Truth of it? I think you will say so: And if so, then it is not obvious to shew how there was such a Congruence from Eternity, when there was Nothing but God; and so no other object for his knowledge to agree to: For in God they were all but one, either in <hi>esse cognito,</hi> or <hi>esse volito;</hi> for in him is no reall diversity: and out of him, or in themselves they were not at all: and therefore if God knew all things as many or divers, when they were not at all, and as existent, when they did not exist, where is the Congruence of the act with the object? But all this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is but light.</p>
               <p>But they further argue thus: Gods Immanent acts, which we are speaking of, are not Himself: and therefore as they may be either diversified or multiplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Division or Composition, so they may begin or end without his Mutation. The antecedent they prove by that common Argument: These Immanent acts about the Creature, are Free; God Freely Willeth the existence of this worm or pile of grass: he so Willed it that he could have not willed it, or nilled it. But his own Being is necessary, and cannot but be: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It seems hard to say, that God did as necessarily Will the pardoning of your sins, as he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily God: Or that he could no more have Willed one pile of grass more or lesse on the earth, or one sand more or lesse on the Sea-shore, or one day more or lesse to any mans life, then he could cease to be God. This is a short way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering <hi>Beverovicius</hi> question, and of answering the presumptuous enquiry, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God could have made any thing better, and a thousand more? <hi>Itane etiam ipsum Numen fato constringitur?</hi> Is it a good Argument? <hi>Deus est: ergo n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And were it not for the Connotation of the Object, it were no Decree, nor to be called, but simply Gods Essence. I am sure Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> will be fully and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough for those that maintain the liberty of the Divine Decrees which we now mention: and therefore I suppose Mr. <hi>K.</hi> will be of the same minde.</p>

               <p>I do not mean by this Argument to conclude that there <hi>must</hi> be (or in all cases <hi>may</hi> be) an Inception or Cessation of those Acts which admit of a formal Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But only thus, that if a formal Distinction be consistent with the Divine simplicity, then an Inception and Cessation of some such formalities (or acts, <hi>quoad formales differentias</hi>) may seem consistent with Gods Immutability: (And I know no other Argument of moment then left, if that be solved.) What these formalities are, I do not wonder, if they give but a dark account: Yet that they are different objective conceptions they agree. And as <hi>Rada</hi> saith, <hi>ad Distinctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem formalem duo requiruntur.

               <p>Some think yet clearer Arguments might be fetcht from the Hypostatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Acts of generation and spiration, or Love, whereby the Son is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, and the holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and from the distinction of Persons in the Trinity. But I will stop here (as having run further then I intended) lest you should mis-interpret me, and think, that I own all these Arguments that I touch upon. I know what D. <hi>Twiss</hi> against <hi>Pennotus</hi> hath said to one or two of them, and what the Schoolmen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly say to the same▪ I mention these only to shew that a full or clear soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these doubts is not also facile and obvious, as you seem to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>I must again intreat you, and every ingenious Reader, to fasten no opinion on me, but what I own, at least none which I disclaim. If I must be of one side in this Controversie, I will be of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> side, and say, that God hath but one act immanent, and that is Eternal. But my thoughts are, that we know not what we talk of when we speak thus, and therefore I will not be of any side in this.</p>
               <p>I think, 1. That God hath no Act at all in proper speech: but both Acting, and Understanding, and Willing are by a very, very, very low remote Analogy ascribed to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet I am ready to think, that as we are fain for our own understanding, to speak of God as Acting, Understanding, Willing, Loving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and also for our own understanding to distinguish his Perfections, Properties, Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are but one, so may and must we as much speak of some of his Acts, as begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending (which yet perhaps do not in themselves:) For the Reason and Necessity seems to be the same. For because the word [Knowledge or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing] is first used and applied to mans act of Knowledge, and signifieth first only such a Knowledge as is diversified by objects; yea and man can have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per positive Conception of a Knowledge which is not diversified by the diversity of Objects (but onely a Negative Conception;) therefore it is that we are forced to speak of Gods Knowledge (and so of his Will and other Acts) as divers or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct: as Divines generally do. And on the same Grounds, as man hath no positive Conception of any Knowledge or Will, about mutable objects, which is not varied with these objects, as to the Being, Beginning and Ending, therefore we must as necessarily denominate Gods acts about such objects, as Beginning and Ending, as we must denominate them Divers. And so we may well say, God willed from Eternity the futurition of the worlds Creation, and Christs Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now he doth not will their futurition, but their preterition: and that he Loveth now (as believers in Christ) those whom he before Hated as Workers of Iniquity; and that he is satisfied and well-pleased in his Son, and his Sacrifice, who was not so before. Me thinks Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should think this language as fit for the mouths and pens of Divines, as the former, and not to be blamed or accused as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135058:26"/> erroneous, because improper, as long as we must speak improperly of God, or not at all. And I am sure that Scripture speaks of God in this language, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to him Immanent acts, as new or as ceasing, and as moved by exteriour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Therefore this way of speaking is not unfit or intolerable.</p>
               <p>The Summe of all that I say therefore is but this, That we cannot conceive of Gods Immanent acts, as in themselves they are (nor are they truely the same things that we conceive of, when we apply the several denominations to them:) and therefore we must conceive of them by Resemblance to the Acts of Man so denominated, still acknowledging the Impropriety of the terms, and disclaiming all those Imperfections which in man they do express.</p>
               <p>But because Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath spoken so much to this point already, its like he will take it ill if I take no notice of it. I will therefore a little insist on the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what he saith on it, to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> pag. 93, 94. (but briefly, as being not to me.)</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135058:26"/> as the Logickmongers do:] But, when these words had raised my expectations of some more exquisite distribution then ordinary, or at least of more apt terms, I am put off with the old distinction, not only common in the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but in the multitudes of Logick and Metaphysick Writers, which I had thought you had disdained: Not the smallest <hi>Senguerdius</hi> but hath it; (onely he, with many others term it, but Barbarous; whereas <hi>Keckerman</hi> terms it <hi>Insipid,</hi> and <hi>Burgersdicius inept:</hi>) And <hi>Rutgersius</hi> saith, that <hi>Analogorum nomine solum ea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur quae secundum proportionem apud Aristotelem vocantur, prout notant interpretes ex cap. 16. post c. 15. maxime verò ex c. 6. 1.

                  <hi>Analogum, [Ens</hi>] as appliable to God and the Creature, that we are now in question of.

Your [Because] is unsound, and I conceive your Consequence is false, <hi>viz.</hi> [then whatsoever is predicated of God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must be predicated Analogically] Do you think that nothing may be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken equivocally of God and the Creature? If you do, you are a singular man. 5. I hope you do not think that our knowledge depends on God, as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents on the Subject: If you do, then God hath many Accidents indeed, were that true: I had rather say plainly, that God effecteth our knowledge (by way of natural Causation in some respect, and by moral Causation in other respects) as that which had no Being before, then to talk of Emanation as a Beam from the fountain of Light; considering what ill use many in these times have made of the doctrine of Emanation. 6. It seems by your former Conclusion [whatsoever is predicated of God and the Creature, must be predicated Analogically] and by your present predication of [The fountain of Light which is in God] that you judge [Light] or [the fountain of Light] to be predicated Analogically of God too. Which if you do, and this also must be by Analogy of Attribution, then it seems Heat, Cold, Gravity, Levity, Density, Rarity, Composition, or what ever is in the Creature may be thus attributed to God. 7. As to the point it self in question, 1. I will not meddle with that old Controversie, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ens</hi> be spoken of God and the Creature Univocally, Aequivocally or Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically. I have seen what <hi>Scotus</hi> saith for his opinion in <hi>Sent. 2. dist. 12. &amp; alibi. &amp; 1. dist. 3. q. 1. &amp;</hi> 3. And what <hi>Anth. Andreas 4. Metaph. q.</hi> 1.

As for the application hereof to our Question, I still affirm, That the thing which the word [Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge] is spoken of, in God, is not only more eminently and perfectly in him then the Creature, but is only in him, and not in the creature at all: And the thing which the word Knowledge is spoken of, or doth signifie in man, is not at all <hi>formaliter</hi> in God, but there is in him something of an Infinite, transcendent Excellency above it, which makes it useless; and in God it would be Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore it may be said to be in God <hi>eminenter non formaliter:</hi> The word [Knowledge] is first used to signifie the knowledge of man: It is translated to press to us that Incomprehensible perfection of God, which we cannot otherwise conceive of or express. Yet when ever we make use of the term, we cannot by it our selves attain to a conception, positive and true, of any higher thing then such knowledge as our own, with some negative additions, for removal of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; as that it is Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that man can have no true positive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Nature of that which in God we call Knowledge: Only he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it to be somewhat like that which in man is called Knowledge. But Like is not the same. As <hi>Goclenius</hi> out of <hi>Aristot. <gap reason="foreign">

But that we may venture on a conjecture, I should rather set the Creature at a greater distance from God then they do: and think that these At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are all Tropical, somewhat Metonymical, but mostly Metaphorical. I never saw (in <hi>Aquinas</hi> or any other Schoolman that spoke for it) any cogent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prove, that <hi>Intelligere, Velle, Agere, Amare,</hi> are attributed to God in any other kinde then <hi>Reminisci, Gaudere, Odio habere, Irasci,</hi> &amp;c.

And who knows not that there is a wide difference of this sort among Metaphors, some being very near, and some so farre fetcht, as to be Catachrestical <hi>Durandus</hi> saith (<hi>in 1. sent dist. 34. q. 4) Nullum nomen attribuimus Deo nisi ex Creaturis: non enim ponimus nomen nisi rei quam intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus; &amp; quia non intelligimus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And when we say <hi>segetes fluctuant,</hi> fluctnation is no more proper to the motion of the waters, then <hi>Intelligere, Velle, Agere,</hi> are to the perfections and action of man, or other rational creatures. And whereas they say that the terms are applied to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135058:29"/> God, with a Remotion of the Imperfections which they imply in us, I answer, So they may say of those lower terms, which they confesse to be Metaphorical, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowing a gradual difference of impropriety. Nor doth it follow therefore that there is no truth in these expressions of God, or that they are no helps to our knowledge of him, or means of demonstration. For Metaphors are not as pure equivocals: There's some common reason in the similitude, though in the first and proper sense the name be proper to one. When we say, <hi>Segetes fluctuant,</hi> we expresse not only Motion, wherein both agree, but a motion of the Corn like that of the Water. I think, as I said before, that it is no more proper to call God <hi>Scientem, Volentem, Agentem,</hi> then to call the Firmament a Nut-shell, because both seem to have a convexity or concavity, or contain something else within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or to call the Sunne <hi>Reptile,</hi> or a creeping thing, because it moves, and so do creeping things: or then it is proper to call Knowledge, Light, or to put <hi>Video</hi> for <hi>Intelligo</hi> (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> cals God the fountain of Light before.) The Scripture saith, <hi>God is Light:</hi> yet I think this will be easily confessed a Metaphor: and I think it is but <hi>Metaphora propinquior,</hi> to say, <hi>Deus Intelligit, Vult, Agit,</hi> &amp;c. And this I judge after long consideration of what <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath said, 1. <hi>q. 14. a. 1. &amp; q. 19. a. 1. &amp; alibi:</hi> and many other Schoolmen to the like purpose.</p>
               <p>Shall I adde one Argument for the Negative (that it is not by Analogy of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, that Knowledge, Will, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are attributed to God and the Creature; as <hi>Ens</hi> is to Substance and Accident) <hi>ad hominem</hi> specially? That Knowledge which is the same thing with Will and Power, cannot be the one of the Analogates with our Knowledge which is not the same; in this kinde of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy <hi>ob inaequalem generis distributionem:</hi> (supposing Knowledge to be the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Analogum.</hi>) But Gods Knowledge is maintained by those that I dispute with, to be the same with his Will and Power) many say, they differ but <hi>denominatione extrinsecâ:</hi>) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the proof of the <hi>major,</hi> consider: Else on the same grounds [Power] might be thus analogically spoken of Gods Knowledge and mans Power: For where there is no difference in the Thing, there needs to be none in the Name, as requisite from the Nature of the Thing (but only from some extrinsick respect or use) But Power may not Analogically be spoken <hi>de Potestate humana, &amp; scientia divina Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Common reason and use of speech confirms the <hi>minor.</hi> It seems therefore to be evident truth, that as it is from si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or some Tropical respect, that Gods Immanent acts, have divers names, rather then one alone: so is it from the same reason that they have these particular names, rather then other: And consequently that these names are not <hi>Analoga inaequalis Attributionis naturae communis;</hi> but <hi>Analoga Proportionis,</hi> or Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical. <hi>Durandus (in sent. 1. dist. 2. q.</hi> 2.) saith, <hi>Alia est opinio quae mihi videtur ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> viz. <hi>quod distinctio attributorum, secundum rationem non potest sumi, nisi per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parationem ad aliquam realem diversitatem actu existentem in creaturis, vel possibilem.

               <p n="3">3. How greedily did I reade on, and follow you at the heels, to see how you proved that it is not spoken of God Metaphorically? and when I come to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, What's the proof? Why you say [surely much lesse may God be onely metaphorically said to fore-know.] You passe your word on it: And this is the knotty Argument that I cannot answer, because I am not of your standing in the University: A little more of the University would have done me no harm (as you say) when I am to deal with this kinde of Argument.</p>

But I dare not say, that God hath formally in himself whatsoever he is the Author of. For he is the Author of Nutrition, Augmentation Composition, of Sorrow, of Fear, of Hell, of Worms, Toads and Vipers. But it was the former (the Metaphorical Denomination, and also that of strict proportion, which some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish from the Metaphorical) which I had hoped you would have disproved.

As if we should dispute, whether the Sunne do creep as <hi>reptilia</hi> do? and I say, Yes, Metaphorically: and you will stand up for the honour of the Sun, and say, we debase it; and that it doth creep without being beholden to a poor Trope for it: Or if the Question were, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sunne be a Vegetative, or sensitive creature? and I say, Yes, Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: for it causeth Vegetation and sense. And you will say, It is Vegetative without being beholden to a Trope. What a Patron is he of the honour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that will prove that he is a Worm, a Beast, Nothing, and his life a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135058:30"/> a dream, a Weavers shuttle, without being beholden to a poor Trope! Yet are these unspeakably nearer, then the names of man and his acts, to God: for <hi>inter finitum &amp; infinitum nulla est proportio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. You conclude that the <hi>famosius Analogatum,</hi> is Gods fore-knowledge, your proof is [Questionless it is so:] As strong as the rest. But, when I look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I finde somewhat like a Reason: [there being Infinitely greater cause to set the Crown on Gods fore-knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] My dread of Gods most sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, forbiddeth me to set on him such a Crown of Vanity. As if the Sun must be the <hi>famosius Analogatum inter Reptilia,</hi> because the Crown of [Creeping] must be set on its head! What if we should yield to you, that the term [Knowledge, Will, Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] being first Metaphorically applied to God, that yet it is partly Analogical <hi>quoad inaequalem Generis attributionem,</hi> the term expressing (though improperly as to one) a Nature common to both? It would not yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that here the more noble sort, even Divine Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the <hi>famo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Analogatum:</hi> For though it be most excellent and unexpressibly glorious in it self, yet the term agreeing first with the lower, even humane Knowledge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is the <hi>famosius Analogatum,</hi> as being the thing most famously and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously meant by that term. If you ask, Whether the Sunne do glissen (as Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, or rotten wood) or do <hi>Rutilare</hi> or <hi>Candere?</hi> If you say, Yea; yet I think the Sunne here is not the <hi>famosius Analogatum,</hi> though the light which this word intendeth be more eminently in the Sun, then in the other things.</p>
               <p>You conclude, that [true fore-knowledge mentioned by it self, must alwayes be understood of the fore-knowledge of God.] Is that so indeed?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why then do the Schoolmen generally acknowledge, that the names are all first applicable to the Creature, though the thing be most excellently in God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then, it seems, it is not a strictly proper speech to say [Man knows, or fore-knows, or Wils, or acteth:] for none of the <hi>Homonyma,</hi> are spoken of both, in strict propriety. But if you would undertake to prove, that God may in as strict propriety be said to Know, Will or Act, as man is, there are many that would undertake to prove the terms Univocal: which in most Divines Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would be to prove, that man is God: an opinion, which our new world in the Moon (<hi>in Anglia lunatica</hi>) have very confidently imbraced of late years.</p>
               <p>In a word, Sir, my thoughts of man, and his Acts, Knowing, Willing, are so low, and my thoughts of the Infinite God, so high, or at a losse, when I go about to have any positive, true apprehensions of his Nature, that I conceive you and I can no more tell what that is in God which we call Knowing, Willing, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, then my Horse can tell what Reasoning or Discourse is in me, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And yet I believe that the Knowledge of God is eternal Life too, <hi>viz.</hi> Now (as to the beginning) to know that there is a God, and that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Him which mans Knowledge, Will, Goodness, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have some exceeding, low, distant resemblance of, and which we cannot better apprehend or express then under such notions, and by such terms; it being yet in it self of more unconceivable excellency. And though I know the Schoolmen are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (without proof) that <hi>Scire, Velle,</hi> &amp;c. do express no Imperfection, but only Modal, and therefore may be applied to God (which I conjecture will also be your Argument) yet I do not believe that Assertion. Comparatively to lower or equal Creatures, it may be said, that it is not Imperfection, which they express. But
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135058:31"/> absolutely or comparatively as to God, it is Imperfection: Not only some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or <hi>Modus,</hi> but the very thing exprest by these terms, is Imperfect: Else the Creature shall have something equal to God, and so be God. And if it were but a Modal Imperfection; yet when the term doth strictly and properly expresse that Imperfect <hi>Modus</hi> it self, as well as the Thing, then that term cannot be applied to God any nearlier then Tropically. Knowledge, Will, Action, and all the terms fitted to man, are so strictly fitted to express the humane Mode, as well as that which you separate in your Intellect, and call perfect, that it cannot be applied to one without the other, but abusively or tropically; No more then [c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ping] is applicable to the swift motion of the Sun, when the term doth intimately signifie the slowness and Mode of the motion, with the motion it self.</p>
               <p>God forbid that I should doubt, whether that in God be Perfect, which we call Knowledge, Will, Action: But what it is that under these names of infinitely remote similitude we do express, what earthly man can tell? Because I believe Gods Immanent acts to be perfect, therefore I believe them not to be the same thing that man apprehendeth under these terms.</p>
               <p>Oh that frail man were more acquainted with his Nothingness! then would he not dare so to lift up himself in comparison with his Maker!

               <p>Having affirmed Justification to be a transient act, and that therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135058:31"/> of it argueth no mutation in God, I was fore't to meet with the opinion of D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Twiss,</hi> who takes it to be an Immanent Act, and therefore if it should begin <hi>de novo,</hi> it would argue a change in God. (Not speaking of that <hi>in fore Conscientiae.</hi>)</p>
               <p>These two Conclusions therefore I took as certain, and necessary to be held of every knowing Christian.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God doth not change.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God doth not pardon or justifie men from Eternity; (no nor from the time of Christs death) and therefore that he doth in time justifie and forgive men, even when they believe. These two Conclusions being Certain and necessary, I take the later as assaulted by D. <hi>Twiss;</hi> who thereby would make them seem inconsistent.</p>
               <p>His Argument is, Justification and Remission are Immanent Acts, therefore from Eternity. To this I answer, 1. By denying the Antecedent: For I had before shewed, that they are Transient acts, and what Transient acts they are. 2. Having premised, that no acts are Immanent in God Positively but onely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively (as <hi>Schibler</hi> speaks;) I answered, That many doubt whether Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts are any further Eternal then Transient acts (which I will open anon when we come to it:) and therefore that this is not a matter of such Certainty as the Proposition opposed is: and therefore Uncertainties must be reduced to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and not Certainties to Uncertainties: <hi>q. d.</hi> I am sure God doth not pardon and Justifie from Eternity from plain Texts of Scripture: But you are not sure that all Immanent acts are Eternal any more then Transient are; Therefore if these two Propositions were as inconsistent as you imagine, yet I would rather hold the former, and let go the later, then hold the latter and let go the former. Here I supposed it objected, that it is not to be endured that any should argue God of mutability: but the foresaid Doctrine doth so: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I answered, that there is no change in God: and they that do hold this opinion, do yet hold it is consistent with Gods Immutability: and I gave two or three short touches of their reasoning: If you ask me, whom I mean, I answer, I mean <hi>Lychetus, Pennottus, Franciscus a Sancta Clara,</hi> and in part <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gersdicius,</hi> in the words which I shall anon cite in his Metaphysicks. And mark that I do not say, that these plead for the Inception or Cessation of Immanent acts: but that Immanent acts are new as Transient are; that is, not <hi>quoad sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiam actus,</hi> but <hi>transitionem in objectum extraneum.</hi> For here it is supposed, that it is not those Immanent acts, whose object is God himself, which is spoke of, but only those that are about the Creature; Note also, that I never thought of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this opinion; but had ever owned the opinion of the Eternity of all Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts; and so farre as the matter is discernable, do hold to it still: but I take the point in Question to be past our reach; and therefore not of such Certainty, as to encourage us to reject a plainly revealed truth, upon supposition of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency.</p>
               <p>After this I returned to my first Position, and made it my full, final Answer, that Remission and Justification are Transient acts, and not Immanent, and that in this I had most Divines on my side, though they did not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily explain the Nature of this Transient Act: which thereupon I more fully explain'd.</p>
               <p>Thus, Reader, I have given the true Analysis of all these words about Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts, which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> makes the occasion of his quarrel with me: and which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135058:32"/> he layeth such a heavy charge on. And, I think, if I had said no more to him, but onely given you this true Analysis, it had been enough to satisfie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and Judicious, and to free my words from that sandy incoherence and senslesness, which (not understanding them) he doth fasten on them in his charge; and to vindicate my self from those corrupt intentions and errours which he intimates.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To this antecedent, I answer, that no Act is properly an effect, or relates as such to the Cause: the Act is rather the Causality then the effect, as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>may please to learn from his great Doctors in the Metaphysicks, whom I think enough to name in general, though he useth to quote them so exactly, as it were the Chapter and verse.</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> IF I have learning enough to understand your meaning, you endeavour in these words to prove two Conclusions. The first and principal (and I think, the whole scope of your writing) is, that I am Ignorant and unlearned. The second and subordinate is, that Immanent Acts are certainly Eternal, or that the change of them will inferre a change in God. The first you prove by my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick citing of <hi>Schibler</hi> and <hi>Burgersdicius,</hi> the Boyes companions, and that as if they were Doctors in the Metaphysicks, and that so exactly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which you think it enough to name. To this I answer, 1. Your Argument labours of two diseases, 1. Obscurity: which may make some, that know you not, conjecture that your design was scarce honest, which you so carry under hand by intimations, when yet it seems the great Cause of this your undertaking: For my part, I think you would never have mentioned my name here, but to this end. 2. Of Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness: If you had stooped so low as to consult me in this business, and opened to me your design, I could by three lines have saved you the writing of these leaves: but that's too late: But yet I may prevent your voluminous labour perhaps for the future, if I do it yet. Be it known therefore to all men by these presents that I <hi>R. B.</hi> do confess my self ignorant and unlearned, especially compared with such as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his <hi>Genius.

               <p>Yet, let me tell you the reason of my crime, a little more fully. I take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good to be the best. I have about thirty T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>actates of Metaphysicks by me (an ill workman, that needs so many tools) and I value these two or three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones which I cited before all the rest: and I think so do the Schools that use them most commonly. Nor do I see any great reason hitherto to take Mr. <hi>K.</hi> for a more learned, authentick, unquestionable Doctor in the Metaphysicks, then <hi>Suarez, Schibler</hi> or <hi>Burgersdicius,</hi> as highly as I value him above my self. Nor indeed did I ever before this, hear of his name (to my remembrance;) much lesse of his Metaphysical writings. But as soon as ever Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Metaphysicks come
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135058:32"/> to my hands, if I do not bow to them, <hi>&amp; vestigiatanti Philosophi adorare,</hi> then let him call me an unreverent fellow.</p>
               <p>Now to your second business: Where, 1. I might better have been understood, if you had not left out the fore-going words; [by Immanent, they must needs mean Negatively, not Positively.] For by this they that see all might have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that, 2. It is Gods acts that I speak of, 3. And you do out of your own brain, affix the <hi>Ergo,</hi> as if it were mine, making that an Argument, which I there take as presupposed. The rest we will come to anon.</p>

Had you confined these speeches of yours only to the Creatures Acts, you had said but as many others have done before you: But it is Gods acts that you speak of, as you ascertain us in your application [and if so, sure Immanent acts in God must needs inferre an alteration.] But indeed do you believe that God is compounded of Substance and Accident? Yea doth the contentious disposition so potently carry you on, that you dare speak in such confident language, as to say that it is [an accident questionless] which you attribute to God? What could <hi>Vorstius</hi> have said more? I thought you had concurred in opinion with your Brethren, that use to call Gods Immanent acts, as diversified and as distinct from his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, only Extrinsick Denominations: But it seems you think otherwise (for a little time, while your hast doth hurry you that way <hi>per modum naturae.</hi>) 2. If you say, That you meant onely this much [Immanent acts are Accidents inherent in man: Therefore they inferre an alteration in God] You might so easily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know that I would deny your Consequence, that me thinks so great a Disputant should not so drily have passed over the proof. I do not stick on the strangeness of the Conclusion it self, that [Immanent acts in God must needs inferre an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;] which is against your self and all Divines, who maintain that there are Immanent acts in God. For I doubt not but your haste which the disputing itch provoked you to, caused you to put [Immanent acts] for new Immanent acts.] 3. But its strange, that you could bethink you of no answer that might be made to your Question [If an Accident, in what Subject?] when you know it is so common to deny that Inhesion is necessary to every Accident; And when you know that in this case an <hi>esse ab,</hi> or a dependant <hi>Egresse,</hi> is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sufficient by so many.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> IS this all the proof that we have waited for [Immanent actions have their terms too?] 1. Either you mean it of all Immanent acts, or but of some, if but of some, then it is a learned Argument: [some Immanent acts have their terms: Therefore there can be no new Immanent acts in God.] But I suppose you mean it of All: But then by [terms] do you mean [objects] which sometime are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>termini?</hi> Or do you mean, the form to which the action tendeth, and which by it is produced or induced? If the first, then the <hi>Terminus</hi> of these Divine acts which we are speaking of, is oft <hi>Without,</hi> (as we use to say;) as when God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Approveth, Willeth, Loveth the Creature. And therefore some few will not call these Immanent acts, but onely those whose object is God himself. But I suppose you mean the later, and then, 3. You might easily foresee, that though I had yielded all that you say of the Creatures acts, yet I would deny it of Gods: And blame me not for it, if I be lesse bold then you: and if I dare not imagine that there is in God either <hi>Motus</hi> or <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or effect, or form acquired, when he Knows, Willeth, Approveth or Loveth the Creature. I am in hope that you believe no such thing your self, when the disputing itch is a little allayed. But however, could you possibly think it so obvious and easie a point as to need no proof? Why have we never a word here to that end, who need so many? I love not these Happy Disputers that can prove that by silence, which neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nor any other can prove by Argument. If you will flie to your Analogy, and say [There are <hi>Termini actionum Immanentium</hi> in man: Therefore there are so in God] I should tell you that you may as wisely say [There are Accidents, Effects and Mutations in man: Therefore there are such in God.] At least I should importune you for the proof of your consequence. 4. But for the Terms of Immanent Actions you say [The said Sages say it] and [he that hath a minde to look it, may soon finde it in <hi>Suarez,</hi> and his <hi>Scapula Schibler</hi>] Truly, Sir, I have hitherto hinted your faults in Ironies: but I think it fit to ask you now (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not once or twice, nor a slip of your pen) how you dare put such things in print, and set so light by honest Truth-telling, and leave such things on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord against your self? You that do <hi>tanto fastu</hi> referre us to <hi>Schibler</hi> as our <hi>Scapula,</hi> sure know his Doctrine: or at least, if you know it not, you should not take on you to know it, and say, we may soon finde that in him, which he so largely and purposely disputes against. He saith indeed, that some Immanent acts have terms, as Syllogizing: but that cannot be your meaning: for you well know it will do nothing to inferre your Conclusion: But doth not <hi>Schibler (l. 2. c. 10. Tit. 3. art.</hi> 3.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135058:35"/>
                  <hi>punct.</hi> 1, 2.) largely dispute it, that many Immanent acts have no terms, no not Vision or Intellection! and answer the Objections against him? and conclude that <hi>Acti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ut sic non dicit respectum ad terminum?</hi> And if Intellection have no Term, then Decree, and the rest that we were mentioning in the beginning, can have none <hi>in agente.</hi> 5. Nay what a great part of the great Philosophers and School-Divines do deny, that Immanent acts are true acts? <hi>Scotus</hi> takes them to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and not in the predicament of Action. <hi>Soncinus, Ferrariensis</hi> (and saith <hi>Schibler Thomistae frequenter ita docent</hi>) deny them to be true acts. And if so, then sure they have not the <hi>terminos</hi> of true acts.</p>
               <p>And I before told you at the beginning of your Discourse, that we do not all agree with you in your Description of an Immanent act, if you mean that it is such as is not only negatively, but Positively terminated in the Agent, as your words import: You may see <hi>Schibler</hi> denying it (when you shall condescend to look it in him) <hi>in Met. l. 2. c. 10. Tit.</hi> 3. n. 54. <hi>&amp; Tit. 5. art.</hi> 1. n. 64. But let this be how it will in man, I do very confidently deny that there is any such act in God, either of Knowledge or Will, as is either in the predicament of Action, or hath any <hi>Terminus</hi> in himself, further then as himself is the object of any act. And therefore you should first prove, that such Acts are in God at all, before you dispute whether they may be in him <hi>de novo.</hi>

Why it is this [I told you so but even now.] This may be a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those that are capable of it: but <hi>recipitur ad modum recipientis:</hi> with me you have lost your Authority, so farre, that I need another kinde of proof. I will rather call it Passion then Action when it is <hi>in Patiente. Forma dat nomen:</hi> and Passion and Action are not the same <hi>formaliter,</hi> whatsoever they may be materially. Use the names promiscuously, if there be no difference in the things.</p>
               <p>You know the subtil <hi>Scotists</hi> say, That Action and Passion are not the same, and that Action is in the Agent. And I have yet seen no reason to preferre you before <hi>Scotus.</hi> But I rather say, that Transient Acts are <hi>ab agente,</hi> but neither <hi>in agente nec patiente;</hi> as having a Cause but no Subject, as I have before expressed.

At least remember that you humbled your self but even now, to use a Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney distinction, with which every dull Jade could maintain the Negative at their pleasure.

                  </gap>itted to the thing) But that were absurd, Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Further, That which is in the Patient is a <hi>Causatum,</hi> or effect of the Agent <hi>per Actionem vel Causalitatem.</hi> But Causality or Action is not a <hi>Causatum</hi> or effect of the Agent <hi>per actionem vel causalitatem:</hi> Therefore that which is in the Patient is not Action or Causality. The <hi>major</hi> needs no proof; and its meant of every received form. The <hi>minor</hi> hath a full demonstration, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Authority; who denieth Action to be an effect. And those that be not moved with his authority, may observe that I here take the word [effect] in the more restrained sense as it excludeth Causality or Action; and therefore that I say [it is not an Effect <hi>per Actionem</hi>] and that is proved fully, in that otherwise, there must be another Action to effect this Action, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> But I did not think to have said any thing on this. All that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can expect we should grant him is, that <hi>Actio qua Passio est in Patiente:</hi> but still <hi>Actio transiens qua Actio non est in Patiente,</hi> no more then is an Immanent action. Or if it were, yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of so many learned gain-sayers, makes the difference seem scarce so clear as that between heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that which in God we call a Transient Act, is by the Schoolmen in greatest credit, affirmed to be Gods Essence only connoting the creature-<hi>Relatio</hi> to it: so that besides the creature it self (which though <hi>Scotus</hi> cals Creation, yet is sure the effect and not the act) and besides the Relation (which can be no proper act) there remains nothing but Gods essence, to be the substance of the Act which we call both Immanent and Transient. <hi>Capreolus</hi> saith, <hi>Nulla Divina operatio aut actio qua formaliter agit aut operatur, est transiens in passum, sic quod in passo formaliter recipiatur, cum ejus agere sit ejus Velle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And though I am loth to put my singer into the fire, by medling with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> any further then he invites me, yet perhaps he may expect I should somewhat take notice what he saith of this point to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> pag. 150, 154.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he saith, [There are so many Immutations in Gods Essence] if transient operations be the same with his Essence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deny the consequence:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135058:36"/> because the <hi>Terminus</hi> or effect is not the same with his Essence, though the act be. The Effect only is Many; the Act but one. 2. To his solution of the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, where he saith, It is a mystery passing all understanding, that God should incline the heart to believe and not act anew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I say, I believe him for the mysteriousness. But as all multiplicity comes from Unity, so do all temporals from that act which is Eternal. To all Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Instances the Schoolmen say, It is the effect only that is New: In giving the spirit, faith, raising Christ; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God had no new act: Yet God did it by <hi>Velle,</hi> which is his eternal act and essence. To his answer to the second Question, I Reply, M. <hi>K</hi>'s Questions are insipid and fallacious. [Did he Plant faith by making Plants? Did he make me to differ by making the world?] For though it was by the same act, yet that act hath divers denominations from its respect to divers objects. To [make the world] conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a particular object, <hi>viz.</hi> the world: and therefore the act which causeth you to believe, cannot be called [Creating the world] not because the act is not the same, but because it respecteth not the same object. The third Question belongs not to me. To the fourth I say as before: the act is Gods <hi>Velle:</hi> his <hi>Velle</hi> is his Essence: Therefore Eternal. His Questions [Whether the world were drowned by the same Act by which it was made? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] are answered as before: It was by the same Act, <hi>viz. Velle Divinum;</hi> but to be denominated variously according to the Variety of objects which it doth respect and connote. Even as it is the same Act which is Immanent and Eternal, which in Time is denominated Transient from its respect to the effect.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pag.</hi> 154. I finde him citing Mr. <hi>G.</hi> as saying [Learned men Generally acknowledge, that (the act) is really and formally one and the same thing with his Essence▪] And Mr. <hi>K.</hi> saith contrary, that [No man ever asserted Transient acts to be the same with the Agent] and that [all Transient acts be the same with the term, say all men that meddle with Metaphysicks] and he appeals to any Reader that hath but tasted the first principles of Logick. Truly these two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are very contrary: and have bewrayed both of them that which they might have concealed with much more credit to their Reading. Yet Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret [Generally] with such limitations as may bring him off in part: but Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s presumption and boldness is intolerable.

I remember Mr <hi>K</hi>'s words in his third Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the sufficiency of [a pair of Sheers and a met yard.] But it is not so farre sufficient without more Reading, as to encourage a tender conscienc't man, to averre untruths so confidently, that [<hi>No man ever asserted,</hi> &amp;c.] And where he saith [The Question is not of the acts of his <hi>Will,</hi> but of his <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c.] Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he not that Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> and the highly honoured Thomists do make God to work <hi>per essentiam,</hi> and say, that his Power is but his Will, called Power in respect to the effect which it doth produce? <hi>Vid.</hi> Aquin. 1. <hi>q. 15. art.</hi> 1. 4<seg rend="sup">m</seg>.

Indeed these are the men that I mean.

It is a very crude passage thus to say [It is much questioned whether ▪all such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Acts are any more eternal then transient Acts:] For if the meaning be that any transient Act be eternal, that is a mystery beyond all that hath been heard: then somewhat was made from eternity: If the meaning be, that no Immanent Act is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And first to your Argumentation against the Eternity of transient acts, it may be replied, that in transient acts you must distinguish between the Act it self, which is called transient, and the Passion or Reception of that act in the subject or the product, or effect of that act. The denomination of <hi>Transient</hi> is given to that act in the later respect as it doth connote the Product, Effect, Passion and Subject: yea is properly taken so from them, as that it signifieth nothing essential to the Act it self as an Act: So that all that same Act which is in Time denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Transient, because in time it did produce its effect, was really from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self, though the effect were not; and so differs not <hi>quoad rationem formalem actus,</hi> from an Immanent act. Proved, 1. The Act by which God created the world, was his simple <hi>Velle:</hi> But Gods simple <hi>Velle</hi> was from Eternity: Therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is indeed denied by such P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nies as <hi>Schibler,</hi> and many more of his minde: but it needs no proof with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> for it is the opinion (I am sure the saying) of D<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
                  <hi>Twiss:</hi> And indeed it comes all to one, as to our business, if you go on the others grounds. The <hi>major,</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> maintains. 2. <hi>Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> operatur per essentiam immediatè: sed essentia divina est aeterna: Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken exclusively as to all acts which are not Gods Essence; and is so common with many Schoolmen, that I will spare the proof (for I perceive its easier taking it for granted then proving it) The <hi>minor</hi> none denieth that confesseth God. So that it is granted Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that these acts were not to be called Transient from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, because they were not received, or rather did not produce the effect but in time: But yet the act which in Time received the denomination of Transient, was it self Eternal: God Willed from Eternity that the Creature should Be in time, and produced it in that time by that Will which was Eternal. So much on that side.</p>
               <p>Now to your Argumentation for the Eternity of Immanent acts, you would receive two several kindes of Answer from the several men that I before told you of.</p>
               <p>One sort of them think that the Thing it self which we call an Act, is nothing but Gods Essence, and so Eternal: but that the transition of this Act to several objects (as <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> cals it) or the Application of it to these objects (as <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> speaks) and so the connotation of, and respect to these objects, is not Eternal, where the object is not Eternal: and withall they think that the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation specifical of the several Acts, yea and the diversification▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them, is taken from these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emporal transitions, or applications and respects to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e objects; and therefore that they must be used as temporal denominations, and it is fittest to say, God Knew, Loved, <hi>&amp;c. Peter</hi> as existing, not from Eternity, but when he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist: Yea they think the very name of an Act, is most fit to be used in this later sense; rather then applied to the pure Essence of God: however some call him in another sense, a simple Act.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:135058:38"/>
               <p>The other sort of men do think, that the very Act it self is some <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dus</hi> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality distinct from Gods Essence, and may begin without his Mutation, as it may be his without his Composition, as I have before said. Now both these sorts will Reply, that your Charge of [making God not Eternal] and of [making al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in God] which you oft repeat, are but your bare word without any proof, and therefore not by them to be regarded. That God fore-knew all things that should come to pass they easily grant you: but if he know not that to be existent, which is but future, or that to be future which is wholly past, they say, this makes not God to be imperfect, or not eternal.</p>
               <p>But I marvel that you still call Gods Immanent Acts [Adjuncts in God] which before you also called Accidents; not fearing hereby to be guilty of making a Compounded God, while you maintain him Eternal: Or not discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you give advantage to your Adversary to maintain, that those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents or Adjuncts which may be in God without Composition, may as well Beginne or End notwithstanding his Immutability, if their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be such as doth Beginne or End. Now to your New Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>

                  </gap> in God, then an alteration in him, beyond reply:] that's a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty way to prevent a Reply: But your confident Assertions shall hereafter be annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated with the weakest of your Arguments, though called Demonstrations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some will take it for a sufficient Reply to deny your Consequence, and think you had dealt fairlier to have proved it. For they will think that there may be in God an Eternal Ground of a New immanent Act, as well as there is of a New Transient act: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewness of the Act, will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prove the newness of the Ground. And therefore you easily suppose that it must be [a ground in God which was not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135058:39"/> before] if the act be such as was not before. But this you should have foreseen would be denied. And if you say, that the newness or change in the effect doth argue something changed or new in the cause; they will deny it; and tell you that then every transient act would argue something new in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those (of whom I spoke before) that maintain that immanent acts as acts need no subject, will think they reply sufficiently by telling you, that the novity of immanent acts, having a ground in God, will only prove that <hi>aliquid Dei vela Deo</hi> is altered, but not that <hi>aliquid in Deo</hi> is altered: because that action speaks but a dependant egress, and not an inhesion. The like they will say as to any form introduced in the subject by immanent acts, who deny to many and most immanent acts, a <hi>terminus;</hi> and particularly to intellection. And if you think that there can be no action without some effect within or without, I refer you for an answer to my <hi>Scapula,</hi> as you conceit him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. However many of us will hardly be brought to beleeve that Gods immanent acts have in proper sense a <hi>terminus:</hi> though mans may.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some will think they Reply sufficiently, by telling you that by [alteration in God] you mean, either [an alteration of his essence] and then they deny your consequence: or [an alteration of some <hi>modus,</hi> or relation, or formality;] and such they will grant; and say, as oft before, that it is no more against Gods immutability, then the existence of that <hi>modus,</hi> relation, or formality is against his simplicity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If when God created the world, he had a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>All consent not the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only</hi> ex parte crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae <hi>and not mutuall.</hi>
                  </note> new relation (of Creatour) which he had not before, and this without change, then he may have a new immanent act without change, for ought you know.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For Gods acts are not so well known to such Moles and Bats as you and I are, that we should be able so peremptory to conclude that the novity of them must needs argue himself to be mutable: we know not so well how much Being, or of what kinde, those acts have.</p>
               <p>So much for Reply to that which is past Reply. Now to the next horn of your Dilemma.</p>
               <p>You say [A ground in the creature there can be none to put a new immanent act in God.] And why? Because [an immanent act hath nothing to do with any thing without the Agent.] 1. How? nothing! neither as an occasion, nor an object? do not you confess within a few lines that something without may be its object? It is ordinarily said, and by some of your friends, that the Attributes and Immanent acts of God are diversified only by extrinsick denomination; as an immoveable rock in the sea that is washt sometime with one wave and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with another, without its own change: (It seems they take the passion or reception of these motions of the waves, to be no change.) So do diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of objects, say they, diversifie Gods acts and attributes <hi>quoad denominationem extrinsecam.</hi> If that be so, then objects specifie those act; <hi>quoad denominationem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecam,</hi> which in themselves are but one: and then the said objects may as well cause a novity as a diversity of immanent acts <hi>quoad denominationem extrinsecam:</hi> And then there is no more impropriety in saying, God doth <hi>de Novo</hi> Will or Nill; then in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aying, that it is not all one, for God to Will my salvation, and to Nill it: see what you have brought your cause to. 2. There are men in the world
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135058:39"/> that conceive of God, as we do of the sun, that is still shining, but not still shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on this or that creature: it may begin or cease to shine on this place or that, without any change in it self or its actual shining: and so they think it is with God as to some of his acts, which have the creature for their objects: And for your objection, That this is a transient act of the sun, I shall reply to it anon, where you mention it.</p>
               <p>But you are again harping on your old string; <hi>viz.</hi> [That immanent acts are terminated in the Agent.] And I again tell you, that Gods acts and mans are not so near kin, as that you may conclude of the termination of his acts from the termination of ours: yea I tell you, that I will not beleeve you that Gods willing or knowing the creature hath any <hi>terminus</hi> in himself (further then as you may say the creature is in himself;) that is no <hi>terminus</hi> strictly ascribed to actions distinct from a meet objective termination. A word of proof. 1. Where there is neither <hi>motus</hi> or mutation there is no <hi>terminus?</hi> But in God acting immanently there is neither <hi>motus vel mutatio:</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think I need not confirm either part. 2. Where there is no effect or form acquired or introduced, there is no <hi>terminus</hi> (in the sense in question:) But in God there is no effect or form acquired or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced (by such immanent acts) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is plain from the common definition of a <hi>terminus.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is past question.</p>
               <p>But here you confess that <hi>the objects of immanent acts may be extrinsick</hi> (Yet I could tell you, that <hi>Viguerius Institut▪</hi> and others conclude, that <hi>Voluntas Divina non habet objectum extrinsecum:) but if subject or term you will burn your Books,</hi> &amp;c. But hold your hand a little. Before I dare be guilty of that, I would fain know what Books they are. But you speak cautelously: for you tell us not who shall be Judge in this business: and if I should shew you never so many that are against you, you may keep your word by saying they all mistake, and by being the Judge your self. But, alas Sir, what cause have you thus to threaten your Books? Who can riddle the occasion of it? I tell you, that as good Philosophers (for ought I yet finde by you) as you, do think that such acts have no subject nor term: and you say, that if any thing extrinsick be the subject or term you will burn your Books! which if you do, let all bear witness that I was no occasion of it: If they have no subject or term at all, then they can have none without. Sure if you were not very quarrelsome you would not in such high words feign him to be your adversary, that saith more against the opposed Point, then your self</p>
               <p>As for that out-leap wherewith you recreate your self, of my coming so <hi>high</hi> as Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> in the sense I spoke I yet desire it not; in the sense you speak (lusorily) I expect it not: nor do I know any man so simple as to compare me with him, or that needed this learned Digression. Yet I confess I thought my self somewhat neerer both Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> and your self then you suppose me to be: For though I was ready to obey your conclusive command, of adoring the footsteps of such, yet I thought not that I had come <hi>infinitely short,</hi> as you here inform me, I do. I thought only God had infinitely excelled the meanest creature. Nay then, if you will be needs our Gods, <hi>Numina Academica,</hi> I am afraid you will shortly be lower then men; and lest I shall hear that news which I equally fear and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, that you and such like will ere long be cast out of that Academical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. But let that go: I suppose [infinitely] was but a high word, by a high spirit, <hi>quasi ab alto,</hi> from a high place. I have stood my self ere now on a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and every thing in the valley seemed small to me.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:135058:40"/>
               <p>But I forgot to tell you one thing: that (though I suppose I know what kinde of termination you mean, yet) you should have spoken more cautelously, and distinguished, and told your Reader more plainly what you deny; and not have resolved to burn your Books, if we prove things without the Agent to be a term in general. For you know that we distinguish of Objects into Motive and Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native; and ordinarily say that the creatures are terminative objects of Gods Will, though not moving objects. <hi>Meurisse</hi> saith (<hi>Metaphys. Scot. li. 1.

Nay I do not once deny the Point (that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts are eternal) but only say, It is much questioned (by others) whether they are any more eternal then transient acts: and annex a touch of some mens arguings for it: concluding only in a parenthesis, that the Point is, as I think, beyond our reach.

Some think that <hi>quoad substantiam actus</hi> Gods knowledge is the same whatever the object be; but yet because [Knowing this or that] connoteth the object with the act, therefore the eternal essence of God simply in it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered is not to be called [Knowledge] much less [the knowledge of this or that creature;] and that without the object it neither is Knowledge, nor ought to be so called; and so as from the object we distinguish Gods Knowing and Willing, so must we the several acts of his knowledge; and though the act <hi>quoad substantiam,</hi> which we call [Knowledge] in God be but one, yet the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> which must give the denomination, being in the respect of that one act to its objects, it is most fit to say that Gods knowledge of <hi>Peters</hi> salvation and <hi>Judas</hi> damnation, is not the same knowledge, though it be the same substantial act: the like is said of his Will: And as this must be said without wrong to his simplicity, so the like must be said of his beginning or ceasing to Know, without wrong to his immutability: and that as it▪ is not all one for God to know the Futurity and the present existence of a thing, so we must say, that he began to know the present existence when the thing began to exist, and that God did not know before the creation, that this proposition was true, <hi>Petrus existit:</hi> and that he ceaseth to know the Futurition of a thing that ceaseth to be future; and that God doth not now know, that Christ will be born and dye and rise: and that therefore immanent acts in God are not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135058:41"/> to be said to be all eternal; but only those that have an eternal object; because the act is to be denominated from its respect to the object: and therefore it being Gods Knowing and Willing which we call immanent acts here, where it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to say that act of Knowledge or Will is eternall, then it is unmeet to say, Gods immanent acts are eternal: but when you will express Gods immutability, it is fitter to say [God is unchangeable, or Gods essence or nature is eternall,] then to say, his knowledge, will, or immanent acts (in this sense) are so: because when we connote not the object, we are to call it Gods Essence, and not Gods Knowledge, Will, or such acts: so that here is no real change in God himself, but only a respective, or modal, or formal (as the <hi>Scotists</hi> speak) or such as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now apprehend, affording new objective conceptions; all the change being in the creature.</p>
               <p>Now how doth Mr. <hi>K.</hi> prove that this doctrine must [make a change in God as well as the object?] why he learnedly affirmeth it. He that can finde a word more, let him make his best of it. But in this case, all the proof lieth on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimer; which we might well have expected from him.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. ANd therefore all sober Divines use to be wary in their expressions in this kinde; acknowledging no difference between Gods knowledge and foreknowledge, but this, that his foreknowledge is in order to the object only, and not of any act of Gods: so that it is not opposed to</hi> post-<hi>science, but it signifieth only a futurity of the object, as was shewed at large in the third Chapter. God knows that that is to day which was not yesterday; but God as perfectly knew it yesterday as to day, and knew at once, all the various successions in time; or did he otherwise, a change cannot possibly be avoided, notwithstanding all Master</hi> Baxter <hi>alleadgeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. IF your first sentence be true, I must lament the paucity of sober Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; for sure I am, that of those which have written on these Points, too few have been wary in their expressions: and no wonder when they are no more wary in their conceptions; and when men dare maintain themselves to have that capacity which they have not, and to know certainly that which they do not, and might easily know they do not: When even such learned men as you will not be perswaded that these things are above your reach, but do with such haughty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention oppose one poor sentence in a Parenthesis (which is all my sentence) wherein I say, it is beyond our reach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You lift up your self too high, in taking on you to judge all those Divines to be unsober, that are not in this of your opinion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the word [prescience] signifie only a futurity of the object, then these are equipollent expressions [<hi>Deus hoc praescit</hi>] and [<hi>Hoc est futurum:</hi>] but that is not true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same humane frailty and distance from God, which makes it necessary to us to ascribe Acting, Knowing and Willing to God, and to conceive of him under these notions, doth equally necessitate us to conceive of his Knowledge and Will, as distinct, and not altogether the same: else we should ascribe a meer name,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135058:41"/> without any conception of the thing named: For we cannot conceive of any such Knowledge as is the same with Willing, nor of any such Willing which is the same with Nilling; and yet we beleeve the simplicity of God. And the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that compelleth us to conceive of Gods Knowing, Willing and Nilling, as divers, <hi>ab objectorum diversitate,</hi> doth compell us to conceive of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things as Future, and his Knowledge of things existent, as divers: yet still we deny a Mutation of God himself; only we conceive as the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, that there is a diversity of the objective conceptions, and that our various denominations have <hi>fundamentum in re:</hi> but what it is, let him tell that knows.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Against all this that which you oppose is but your naked assertion, which I regard less then perhaps you expected. I affirm the uncertainty, and you the certainty; and therefore it is you that should prove that certainty which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to have: For no man hath a certainty without some evidence or other to force assent; and therefore that evidence should be produced, if you are indeed a man of as Angelicall intellectuals as you seem to conceit your self.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K.

You did take the easiest course imaginable, to fain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion which you could grant, and then to grant it and say it is nothing to the business. 4.

It seems then it must be immanently: but that is but <hi>in sensu Negativo▪</hi> because it is not transient: suppose next that the rest of the creatures were afterwards made, and placed as they are under the influence of this sun, and so were the receptive subjects of its action: Is it not the same sort of Action, without any change in it self, which before was immanent, and now is become transient?</p>

YEt thirdly, Did it hold, I yield it were</hi> Argumentum a majori ad minus▪ <hi>If the sun be not changed notwithstanding all its warmth and lightening, then neither were God. But sure the sun is changed, and changeth perpetually, and could not act as a Universall cause upon the great variety of creatures in the world, did it not rejoice
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135058:42"/> like a Gyant to run its course; did it stand still but one year together at one point, yea or but walk within one Hemisphere for a year, What should we do for that variety of seasons we need? All Summer would be as bad as all Winter. In opposition to this change of the Sun, is the Father of Lights said to be without shadow of turning. He hath no such</hi> Solstices <hi>or</hi> Tropicks; <hi>no motions, but a perpetual permanency. There is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Immanent acts and transient: that supposing the Sun to stand still as in</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's <hi>time, and to act without motion; here were no alteration to be acknowledged in the Sun, notwithstanding all the variety of objects, yea and variety of operations upon those objects, all which might proceed from the same Act as to the Sun, the difference being meerly in the Patient: As for instance, the same live-coal doth at once by its heat melt the wax, and harden the clay; here are different transient acts, but no change or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all in the fire; but only in the disposition of the matter on which it works. But in Immanent acts the Case is contrary; for they being in the subject, the variation of them makes an alteration in that, and not the object: as the same man unchanged may be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject sometimes of mens Love, sometimes of their hatred: the variety of these acts makes a difference in the Agent, doth not alwayes suppose any in the Object; and so here, Gods knowing now that this is, Gods not knowing yesterday, that it is now, makes a change in God, but indeed God cannot be said now to know that such a thing is, but to know that now such a thing is [which was not before] and this he did know, what ever is now even from all eternity, his prescience being a Knowledge</hi> in praesenti <hi>to him▪ though not</hi> de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti, <hi>as to the object; against whose being in eternity more shall be said hereafter against M</hi>

Do you intend the information of your Reader, or the discovery of Truth, when you shuffle in such an alien Answer? 2. All that its good for, that I know of, is to acquaint us, that you have some full Demonstration against <hi>Copernicus,</hi> which hath given you a Certainty that he erres; And if one▪ should hear it, perhaps it would prove like your Ordinary Demonstrations: for that which is hint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d in your words, seems of kin to them. 3. You yield all that I say concerning the Sun, acknowledging that it is not changed by the variety of Objects: And in the first words you say [Did it hold, I yield it were <hi>Argumentum à majori ad minus.</hi>] Lay both these together, and judge whether you yield not the whole Cause which you opposed. 4. You still harp on the old string, affirming, Immanent Acts to be in the Subject, and that their variation alters it, when as good Philosophers say they have no Subject, and that Vision, Intellection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no <hi>Termini:</hi> Your naked affirmations so oft repeated, rather weary then convince. 5. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you cannot from mans Immanent Acts, argue to Gods, unless they were more like. 6. I am unsatisfied whether a Transient Act (though not <hi>qua</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient) make not as much alteration on the Agent as an Immanent? Whether a Transient act be not the same with the Immanent, containing in it all that it contains, with the superaddition of its Reception in, and effect upon a Passive Subject? As in the fore-mentioned instance: If the Sun had been created first alone, its action whereby it now lighteth and heateth, would have been imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135058:43"/> and yet when the same action shall afterwards become transient by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of other creatures to be its Objects, who will imagine that it is ever the less in the Subject (as you say) or that the alteration of it would make ever the less change of the Agent? I confess, I conceive not yet why there should in this point of changing the Agent be any difference between Immanent acts and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient: though I easily conceive that one only doth change the object. 7. Your friend M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Jeanes,</hi> pag. 231. useth the similitude of [a Rock in a River standing immovable, notwithstanding the succession in the waters that glide by it;] which I think is as defective a similitude, as these here used: yet its plain, that you cannot truly say, This Rock toucheth the water that is an hundred miles from it. Suppose the Sun were an eye, and could see all the world at once, and that <hi>pura activitate sine receptione specierum ab objectis:</hi> Suppose one man be born, or one flower spring up this day, which was not in being or visible yesterday: This Sun would see that to day which it did not see yesterday without any mutation in it self: And yet <hi>seeing</hi> is an Immanent act. Now I would know, whether it be fit to say, This Sun sees that as in <hi>being</hi> which is not in being: Or, Whether it be not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to say [It begins to day to see that Creature which begun this day to exist] though by so beginning it be not changed? Its true, God <hi>fore-knows</hi> all things that shall be: but that is not to <hi>know that they be,</hi> but that <hi>they shall be.</hi> 8. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Jeans ibid.</hi> saith [Yet this is no hinderance but that there may be and is a change in the extrinsecal Denominations of Gods knowledge from the variation of the objects hereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] so others commonly: And may I not hence conclude, 1. That then I may denominate Gods knowledge of the present existence of things, as Beginning with its object: and his knowledge of the existence or futurity of things, as Ending with its object; that is, when the thing ceaseth to be future or to exist? 2. And may I not conclude, that this Denomination is fittest, and so those that thus speak, do speak more fitly then they that speak otherwise? 3. And that there is some <hi>fundamentum in re</hi> for such a denomination: or else it were an unfit denomination, seeing names and words should be fitted to the things signified as neer as may be? 9. Do not you imply as much your self, when you say his Prescience is a Knowledge <hi>in praesenti</hi> to him, though not <hi>de praesenti?</hi> You confess then that God doth not know <hi>de praesenti,</hi> the things that now are not: but when they exist he knoweth them <hi>de praesenti;</hi> I confess the doctrine of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence of all things with God in Eternity, would salve many of these things: but that you here disclaim. 10. Where you say, that [Indeed God cannot be said Now to know that such a thing is, but to know that now such a thing is (which was not before, as in the <hi>Errat.</hi> you adde)] it is a saying which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, and conjecture it is still maimed of some necessary limb which should make it speak your sense: For I hope you do not believe what ever you say, That Indeed God cannot be said Now to know that those things are, which are indeed: If he know it not Now, when will he know it?</p>

I am one of those Hereticks, that think these works of God must be the matter of our admiration, but cannot be comprehended by us here: and that it is no good consequence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you and your fellows nakedly affirm the contrary (yea notwithstanding all your proofs) therefore <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>K. Digby. White, Hobbes,</hi> besides all the old Adversaries, are certainly in errour. I shall acknowledge more action of the Light, or air on the glass, then of the object, which seems but <hi>sine qua non.</hi> But withall I suspect, that the same Light or air doth perform the same action in the glass when you stand not before it, or when the object is absent; and yet no <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> is then seen; no nor visible. And I think that there is the same action on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glass-window, yea on every wall, or stone, or other body, as is on your <hi>speculum;</hi> and yet you see nothing on them as you do on it. And <hi>Hobbes</hi> saith, That it is in the eye and not in the glass, which you think you see in the glass (his reproaching of our Doctrine of visible <hi>species,</hi> I pretermit:) and if so, then there is not so much alteration in the glass, as you imagine. And indeed, you say little to prove it. If your Argument from sight would prove any thing, it would prove that the face is a foot or a yard (or more if you draw back) behinde the glass, and not in the glass: And yet if you go behinde you shall see nothing: Will you believe your eyes that things change into such various colours, and shapes, and quantities as some glasses by small mutations of posture do represent them? Will you believe your eyes that a strait staff is crooked in the water? I can tell you by my observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when I was a Boy, that if you will kill a Fish in a River with a Gun, you must allow much to the fallacy of your <hi>medium.</hi> If then either it be the action of the light or air, or something else, and not the object, then it is nothing to me, who spoke only against a change by variation of objects: Or if the foresaid action being supposed to be the same on the glass, when several objects, or no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are before it, that which is superadded from the object is <hi>nihil reale,</hi> this is nothing against me: Or if the <hi>species</hi> which seems a foot behinde the glass be not in the glass, but in the eye or some where else, and so the glass be more truly an Agent by Reflection, then a Recipient of that <hi>species</hi> which I see, still this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against what I said. So that laying aside all that Reception of the action of light, or any thing else, which the glass receives when there is no object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and laying aside all that which is Received into the eye and air, and not in the glass, and whereof the glass is but a <hi>Causa sine qua non;</hi> then call the rest an <hi>Ens intentionale</hi> or <hi>spirituale,</hi> or what you will; but prove it to be <hi>quid reale</hi> altering the glass, and do not nakedly affirm it.</p>
               <p>You say, that my great Logick and Metaphysick Masters say, That <hi>Ens intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi> is opposed to <hi>Reale &amp; Materiale:</hi> and yet you say that the <hi>species</hi> in the glass is not opposed to <hi>Ens reale.</hi> It is, and it is not, seem reconcilable to you then without
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135058:44"/> a distinction. Indeed as Real is opposed to [feigned] I doubt not it is Real, but as it is opposed to Modes and Relations, and such like, that some place between <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Nihil,</hi> it must better be known what it is, then the name of <hi>Ens intentionale</hi> or <hi>spirituale</hi> will acquaint us, before we can conclude for certain that it is Real.</p>
               <p>As for your Material Accident, it will require more ado to prove, that there is any such thing in the world, as an Accident depending on the Subject alone for support, especially a quality, as you instance in: Sure you intend not the withdrawing of the influence of every efficient, but of some lower or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental: I think, at least, Gods efficiency is necessary to be continued, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the being of every Accident, and ordinarily some lower efficiency too.</p>
               <p>As for the Logick and Metaphysicks which on all occasions I spill, I take the charge as unfit to be answered, as not coming from your head or heart, but from your Naturals, your spleen and gal.</p>
               <p>My Ignorance in comparison of you, I am so easily brought to acknowledge, that I wonder you should think so many words necessary to evince it: (yet you should have done it in intelligible language, and not abrupt expressions, defective of sense, almost such as <hi>Hierom</hi> describeth in his <hi>lib. 1. cont. Jovin. initio.</hi>) But how did you prove my Ignorance or Incogitancy of <hi>Ens intentionale?</hi> Deep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! Because I did not mention it, or else who knows why? By that reason I am ignorant that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> K. is an honest man, because I do not mention it; But by what is said, you may see its possible to have heard talk of <hi>Ens intentionale,</hi> and yet to think this similitude tolerable.</p>
               <p>And what if you obtain all that you contend for? <hi>viz.</hi> That the similitude is faulty! Alas, I shall easily grant it of any similitude whereby we illustrate the Nature or Acts of God. Suppose then that this glass did make the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations <hi>sine receptione specierum:</hi> Or because these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>NOw whereas Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>addes, That whatsoever some say, he doth not think, that the beholding of ten distinct colours at one view, doth make ten distinct acts of the sight, or alterations on it; I do not think that ever rational man said they do, for it were strange there should be but one view, and yet ten distinct acts of sight; but the question is, Whether the change of one of these objects doth not change the</hi> species <hi>in the eye, and so occasion another view or sight? Or rather it is beyond all question that they do▪ and yet whether they do or no need not be questioned neither; the point that lies before us, is, Whether distinct or new acts do not Cause an alteration? Which is that that we have just Cause to affirm with confidence, can have no place in God; and consequently no new immanent Act; so then there being nothing produced by Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>which may sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest a suspition that there may new Immanent Acts be admitted in God, or any but such as are Eternal, Come we to the</hi>—</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> YOu are minded to play with the ambiguity of the word [View] which I take for all that Reception in the eye, or activity of it which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135058:45"/> in one Instant; and so for that natural Act whereby I fix my eye on one place at once, seeing as many things as at once I am capable of seeing: You take it, it seems for your intentional Action, or also the act which the visive power performeth, as in reception of that alone. I think the sense I use it in, is more common. And I say again, that it is none of our question, what light, air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do on the eye: for they do no more when I behold one Rock, then when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the sands on the shore: But the Question is, What the objects do over and above on the eye? And whether if I see many millions of millions of sands at one instant, there be so many Real Actions of my eye at that instant? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every distinct sand that is added or taken away, there be one Act added or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and so a real alteration in my eye? The rest which you adde is over and over answered before, and therefore being ashamed that I have, said so much on so unprofitable a point (though constrained) I surcease: Onely adding this brief rehearsal of what is said before.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember that we speak not of those Immanent acts whose object is Eternal: but of those that have a temporary object, as the actual existence of things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. These kinde of Immanent Acts may be called Transient after a sort, in that they do <hi>quoad Terminationem objectivam,</hi> pass to an extrinsick object.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Agere,</hi> in the sense now taken, when applied to God, signifieth something more then meerly <hi>Esse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The whole Generical Essence of Action is found in the <hi>species</hi> of Action.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Intelligere, Velle, Amare,</hi> relate to some Objects: <hi>Qui Intelligit, aliquid Intelligit: qui Amat, aliquid Amat.</hi> These terms therefore do alwayes (when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as being in God) connote their Objects.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a necessity therefore that the acts be variously denominated from the diversity of objects. It is no way fit to say, That God doth Nill Good, or Will sin, or that his <hi>Velle &amp; Nolle</hi> is all one: Or that his <hi>Intelligere &amp; Velle</hi> is all one. For, as it is said, the Act connotes the Object: and therefore we are not so much as to ascribe the act to God when there is not an object for it; or as to an aliene Object. Else we might say, <hi>Dei Intelligere &amp; Velle sunt idem: Deus Intelligit Peccata: Ergo Deus Vult peccata:</hi> And that God Nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Good, because he Willeth Good, seeing in God <hi>Vells</hi> and <hi>Nolle</hi> are all one.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This necessity of various extrinsecal denominations is ordinarily confessed by the most rigid Divines. I shall cite one more anon.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Denomination hath <hi>fundamentum in re,</hi> or else it were delusory and abusive; these being the fittest names that most agree to the Things (of which see <hi>Mcuriss. Metaph. Scoti, li. 2. c. 3. Conclus. 3. &amp;</hi> Durand. <hi>l. 1. dist. 19. q. 5. §. 13, 14. &amp;</hi> Aquin. <hi>de Veritate, Mater. 7. q.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c.) Notions and Names are true or false, as they agree or disagree to the things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. On the same ground as God may thus be said to Understand, Will, Nill, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and these may be said to be not the same, he may also be said to have divers acts of Intellection, Willing, Nilling, and these not to be the same: <hi>e. g.</hi> That it is not all one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o elect <hi>Peter,</hi> and to elect <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Whatsoever this diversity of names implieth, as its foundation in God, (whether a bare Relative diversity, or also a Modal, or what ever the like) it is certain that it implieth no Composition in him, but it is onely what is consistent with his simplicity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Some of the objects of Gods Knowledge and Love, are not from Eternity.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135058:45"/> The Existence is more then the meer <hi>Esse Volitum,</hi> or Will that they shall exist: And it is not all one to know the Thing it self in it self, and to know it in its Cause. Though God therefore did from Eternity intuitively know the <hi>Esse Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litum,</hi> and know the Creature in himself its Cause, and know its futurity, and so fore▪ know all things: yet it follows not that he intuitively knew the Creature in it self, as existing, (Unlesse we assert the co-existence of all things in Eternity with God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. There is therefore the same reason to Denominate Gods Intellection, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as beginning and Ending with its Objects, as there is to denominate them as divers from the diversity of objects. And therefore this is a fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary way of speech. It is not fit to say, God is now Creating the world <hi>quoad actionis formalitatem,</hi> though you over-look the effect: it is not fit to say, That God now knows that the world will be Created (unlesse you respect some new Creation) or that <hi>Abraham, Moses, David,</hi> shall Die, or that Christ shall rise again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. This Denomination of Gods acts as beginning and ending, hath as much foundation in the thing, and is as true as the Denomination of his acts as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And this may as well consist with Gods Immu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mark here that the reason which <hi>Baronius, Burgersdicius</hi> and others give against Gods change of his Decrees, <hi>viz.</hi> he should be morally mutable, holds not of the immanent acts which presuppose their objects, and whose objects are really mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: as <hi>Baronius</hi> here manifesteth. It is certain that things are sometime future, sometime present or existent, and sometime past: and that they are so is of God, but without moral mutation: therefore his Knowing them so, and his Willing and Approving them so, is without moral mutation too. So the same man is good or holy to day that was bad and unholy yesterday: therefore God may love him to day with complacency and approbation, whom he disliked before; and may know him to be as he is, which before he did not, because he was not as he is. 2. Note the reason why God cannot change his Decrees: Both because they do effect or produce their own objects (as commonly called) viz. <hi>Rerum futuriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,</hi> when as Gods Approbation, his Knowledge <hi>purae visionis,</hi> his Complacency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do presuppose their objects. 2. And it would be a contradiction for the same event, to be future and not future, <hi>e. g.</hi> mans salvation: therefore if God absolutely Decree that <hi>Peter</hi> shall be saved, and after Decree the contrary, the first Decree must be changed causlesly, and for want of power not be executed; and also as it is <hi>verbum mentis,</hi> it must be false: which cannot be.</p>
               <p>I Had thought to have said nothing of particular Scriptures that speak of Gods acts which we call Immanent as Beginning or Ending, because they are so commonly known: But lest any should think I slight Scripture Argument, which I principally esteem, or lest they take it for granted that there is none such, because none are produced, I will adde some texts in confirmation of the <hi>minor</hi> of this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Argument.</p>
               <p>If God himself in his Word do ordinarily speak of his own Acts, which we call Immanent, as Beginning or Ending, then is it not unfit for us to do so to. (God knows best how to express his own Acts.)</p>
               <p>But God himself in his Word doth ordinarily speak of his own Acts, which we call Immanent, as Beginning or Ending:</p>
               <p>Therefore.</p>
               <p>Luk. 2. 52. <hi>Jesus increased in favour with God and man.</hi>] Gods [favouring] Christ is an Immanent act: and yet Christ increased in Gods favour: Increase signifieth mutation, by an inception of further degrees.</p>
               <p>Rom. 9. 25. <hi>I will call them my People which were not my people, and her Beloved which was not beloved.</hi>] Love is an Immanent act.</p>
               <p>Joh. 16. 27. <hi>The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me and beleeved,</hi> &amp;c.] Therefore it was when they beleeved and loved Christ, that the Father in this sense began to love them.</p>
               <p>Joh. 14. 21, 23. <hi>He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>Pro. 8. 17. <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> &amp;c.] Therefore with this same love, they were not before beloved, though with another sort of love they were.</p>

B.</hi> IF this also be intended against me, then, Whether this Learned man did not want work, when he undertook this, I leave the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge. The former Question which he propounded to dispute, he knew and confessed that I denied not: (Yet he hath forced me to spend many words on it, and to say more then I thought to have done.) This which he makes his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Labour, he will not say that I was ever his adversary in; or that ever I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the Proposition, much less denied it: And yet all this seems intended against me, and by name anon he brings me in. If this man had not somewhat <hi>ab ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> more forcible then any thing in the matter disputed, which instigated his pugnacious soul to this conflict, then must I confess my self quite mistaken in the Motives of his undertaking. The former part of his Dispute hath convinced me of this. I remember we had such sparks among us when I was a School-hoy, that were wont (for maintaining the reputation of their valour) to appoint fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matches, and to the field they must go, before ever they thought what should be the matter of quarrel, and when they came to the place, they must be dared by a third, to spit in anothers face to make the quarrel; and he that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed was the Coward, and he that spit first, and struck first, had the first glory, though sometime not the last.</p>
               <p>What I should do with all these following words of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s that concern me not, I do not well know.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135058:50"/> it! Yet because I take his Discourse to be very feeble, and to small purpose, I shall take a brief notice of it in the way, whether it were intended against me Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or but Colla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But this I will not insist on; but run another course, and that is this: Justification is by the Consent of all men (I mean Protestants) a Remission of our sins, and Accepting of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

I know no man will say it is a meer transient Act: there being no transient Act of God which doth not suppose an Immanent one; for that he acts nothing upon the Creature, but what he first purposed in himself to act: so then an Immanent act there must be confest, if there be a transient one; and a transient one I shall acknowledge as well as an Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and what it is will enquire by and by: But first I contend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t immanent Act there can be no other then the Decree of God to pass this transient Act, and that this Decree of God to pass the transient Act of Justifying, carries in it as much as concerns Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and Acceptance of us as Righteous; and therefore hath much in it like to Justification; and may be stiled so without Blasphemy, as Mr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>is pleased to brand it in his Rhetorick. And that this Decree to Justifie us, carries as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Remission of sins, and accepting of us as righteous, I prove thus: If it do not, then the Remission of sins, and Accepting of us as Righteous, are other immanent Acts. But that cannot be, for then, either in the Ʋnderstanding or Will: but neither can be said with sobriety, for sure God cannot be said to Decree to know any thing, or to decree to Will any thing: not to know any thing: for though he know things in his Decree, yet doth he not decree to know, his Knowledge being necessary, his Decree arbitrary: and if he did decree to know any thing, we must conclude he might have not known it; for decrees are only of things which may be or not be: Therefore whatsoever it be, it is no such distinct immanent Act in Gods Ʋnderstanding; and though we use to say,</hi> Now a man is Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Gods sight, <hi>yet doth not this put any new Act of Knowledge in God, but signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies only a Testimony given by God, whereby he makes us know that we are Justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or in his sight; and I am sure that Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>who quoteth</hi> Suarez, Schib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>and</hi> Keckerman <hi>at every bout, cannot be ignorant that the word of fight, though it be for the form Active, is for the substance of it rather Passive, and therefore is not attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God as it is to us; but in him it signifies a making of us to see, and we are said to be Justified in his sight, when he makes it as it were evident to our sight that we are Justified: as when God is said to know what was in</hi> Hezekiahs <hi>heart, the meaning is, he made known to</hi> Hezekiah <hi>what was in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To Decree to Will God cannot be said; for that is as much as to Will to Will, which was never heard of, the object of the Will being at best but the imperate Act, not his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> I Confess I had farre rather be imployed in debating the point of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then of Gods Immanent acts, which you before insisted on. But to deal freely with you, I never read from a Learned, Orthodox man, a more superficial, unprofitable Discourse on that Subject, or that less expresseth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent understanding of the point, if my Judgement fail not, as probably it may.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To what purpose you tell us what Arguments you will not use (<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.) I know not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though I little know to what good use it would be, to acquaint us <hi>what is like Justification,</hi> yet, me thinks, were it useful, it should have been better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And first me thinks your Memory fails you (which you had need to take extraordinary care of:) The last Discourse was much spent in shewing that [there is a <hi>great</hi> difference between Immanent Acts and Transient] and that [there is a clear difference between them as between heaven and earth: Transient Acts being in the Patient, and Immanent in the Agent] So that to equal them in Eternity [is either to make the Creature eternal, or to deny God to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.] And now the second Discourse must be to prove them to be like: For the Decree which is an Immanent Act hath somewhat like Justification, which you confess a Transient Act. But yet I doubt not but your Learning can make this good: For you that can prove that Gods Immanent Acts which are his Essence, do differ no more from poor mans, then as you have expressed, may well prove, that Gods Immanent Acts are like Transient Acts; much more that Heaven and Earth are like. And doubtless your undertaking is very feasible: For you may well prove, that there is a similitude between Gods Immanent acts, and a stone, or a tree, or a worm, or any thing in the world: For you will say, that Gods Immanent acts are God himself, and that these Creatures are all Good: and then all things that are Good, are somewhat Like to God: Therefore every thing in the world (having some Good) is somewhat Like God: Also they have a Being, and therefore have some likenesse to the first Being. But then what Likenesse this is, or in what Degree, you have more Wit then to undertake to tell.</p>

Because indeed it saith as much (for ought I know) to prove Gods Decree to be like Glorification, as to be like Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Should you not have told us in what sense you take Justification before you
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135058:51"/> define it? Who knows whether you mean Justification Constitutive, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall? (not to speak of the many other distinctions of Justification.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. Why would you tell the world what <hi>all Protestants</hi> take Justification to be? as if you knew them all?</p>
               <p n="7">7. At least, how comes it to pass that so Learned a man hath read so little, and would bewray it so easily? as to say that [All Protestants consent that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the Remission of sin, and Accepting of us as Righteous?] Would you be believed in such notorious untruths which you fear not to utter even▪ in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, where there is so much visible evidence against you? How many of our English Divines (besides all others) affirm Remission of sin to be a fruit or consequent, and no part of Justification? had you read but Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> you would have known some. How many on the other side make Remission of sin antecedent to Justification in order of nature? and Justification to be its immediate consequent? How many take Remission of sin to be the whole of our Justification? yea what full Disputes and Treatises are written only or principally, or at least very much to prove this? and what famous Divines are they that maintain it? How many be there that take Justification to consist part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Remission of sin, and partly in the imputation of Christs own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? and these with the former say, that Accepting us as Righteous is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Justification: Sin must first be remitted, say the former, and Christs Righteousness imputed ours, say the later, before God can Accept any man as Righteous: For man must first be Righteous, before he can be accepted as such▪ Yea Mr. <hi>Arthur Dent</hi> in his Catechism, defines justification to be, A cleansing and renewing of our nature by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The number that are of these several opinions are so great, and the men▪ so eminent, and well known to Divines that have been much verst in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, or are of any considerable reading in our Modern Writers, that I shall think it needlesse to cite any of them. Hath Mr. <hi>K.</hi> read none of all these▪ or will he blot out their Names from the number of Protestants?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yet more grossely doth he affirm, that he [knows no man that will say it is a meer transient act.] I think then you have either read little of this Controversie, or little remember what you have read: at least, are an unfit man to tell us what All men hold, or all Protestants, when you profess to know so little. You might have seen this in some plain English books, that are in the hands of the multitude of those below you. Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker</hi> maintains it, That Justification is not an Immanent but a Transient act. But what need I name any, when it is known to to be the common Judgement of our Divines, and those few that have maintained Justification to be an Immanent act (and consequently eternal) have been taken for Erroneous therein, and as militating so farre for the Antinomians. See Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi> of Justification, <hi>Lect. 20. p.</hi> 167, 168, 169.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If Justification be a Transient act, and yet not a meer Transient act, then is it both an Immanent and a Transient act. And if so, then either it is two acts, or else the Immanent and Transient act are one. If Justification (Active) be two acts, then it seems it is divisible; yea and one part of it is Eternal, and the other in Time only: And then we must not enquire, What the justifying act is? but What each of these justifying acts are? Of this if I knew your minde, perhaps I might say more. If the Immanent and Transient act be but one, dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (1. As in the meer form of an Act, having not yet effected any thing; 2. And as the same act is received into the subject Passive, and so is the Passion)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135058:51"/> then the same act is no more immanent, when it is once transient; and then we must say, that the act of Justification was eternal, but the passion or effect in time only. But this sense seems so much to contradict, both your foregoing discourse of the difference of Immanent and Transient acts, and your after hint of the Transient act which justifyeth, that I will not imagine it to be the sense you intend.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But your reason why no man will say it is a meer transient act, is very darkly discovered: It is because [there is no transient act of God, which doth not suppose an immanent one.] But doth it follow that therefore Justification is not a meer transient act, because it supposeth an immanent act? Why did you not tell us whether it suppose it as an antecedent, or as a part of Justification, or as what else? But you know that all that is supposed is not therefore a part. Or if it were never so necessary a foregoing cause, yet it follows not that the neerer cause may not be <hi>causa totalis in suo genere,</hi> and so be denominated. May not you on these grounds as well say, that there is nothing in the world is a meer transient act, because it supposeth an immanent? The building of a house I think is a transient act; and yet it supposeth divers immanent acts in the builder, and an immanent act of God that willed it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But what is this immanent act? You adde [For that he acts nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature, but what he first purposed in himself to act.] I doubt not but you easily see, that if this reason prove any thing, it will as well prove that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Redemption, Sanctification, Resurrection, Glorification, are none of them meer transient acts: For God acts these in Time: and therefore he first purposed to act them. Yea it will do as much to prove that God never did, nor can perform a meer transient act: because he can do nothing but what he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. What need you then apply this to Justification any more then to any thing else? as if Justification had any peculiar participation in this honour, above some other acts! By your reason, the dividing the red sea, the sending of Manna and Quails, the writing of the ten Commandments, were none of them meer tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient acts.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Immanent acts pass not into the extrinsick objects and make no change on them, and therefore are not causall: and therefore cannot well as causals be denominated from their effects: therefore no immanent act of God can be called Justification, or part of Justification, or a justifying act: For it must be so denominated from the effect of justifying: But it is the transient act only that effecteth Justification (Passive:) therefore it is the transient act only that is to be called Justification.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I have oft times asked the Antinomians, what text of Scripture they could shew that calleth any Immanent Eternal act of God by the name of Justification, or of part of Justification? and I could never yet see any that they produced: and I suppose that you are also unable to shew any such; or else you would its like, have done it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. When you say [God decreed to Justifie] do not you plainly make [De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing] and [Justifying] two things? and denominate only the transient act which is in time [Justification?] So of other▪ acts; as when we say [God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to create:] you do not say, His Decreeing was Creating.</p>
               <p n="15">15. You conclude that [an Immanent act must be confest if there be a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient one.] <hi>Ans.</hi> It is easily confest that an Immanent act (so called, for our understanding) there is from Eternity concerning every thing that is in Time
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135058:52"/> produced: but that proves not that the producing act in Time, is not meerly transient. I all this while suppose that you mean by denying Justification to be [a meer transient act] to include some other act justifying, or as part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and not only to prove an antecedency or concomitancy of such an Immanent act. Else your reasoning would be absurd or against your self.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Having thus proved that there must be an Immanent act, you next say, that [There can be no other then the Decree of God to pass this transient act.] Your contention for this is bold, your proof of it weak. As Gods immanent acts are the same with his Essence, so he hath but One, that is, he is but One: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Willing, Nilling, is all One; and so there is but one Immanent act in Justification, Condemnation, or what you will else, because there is but One God: Or rather God hath nothing properly called an Act, because he is God. But as we ascribe One act to God Analogically speaking of him according to our capacity, so must we on the same necessity ascribe to him more then One, and that is by denominating them from the variety of objects which they respect and connote. And so as truly as you can distinguish between the Divine Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Volition, so truly may we distinguish the Volitions of God, according to the divers state of the objects. And so if we could yield to you that there is any Immanent act a part of Justification, or that carrieth in it as much as concerneth acceptance of us as Righteous, we might fairly say as much, at least, for another act, as you can do for the Decree: For the Decree that you speak of, is only [a Decree to pass a transient act] and so hath for its object something future: But the Will of God <hi>de pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So is his mentall approbation, and his acceptance of the person as Righteous (Willingly and Approvingly judging him Just;) some call his estimation of us to be Just <hi>sententiam conceptam</hi> as distinct from <hi>senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia lata,</hi> but neerer to it then the Immanent Decree to pass an act <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="17">17. You adde [That this Decree of God to pass the transient act of justifying, carries in it as much as concerns Gods remission of sins, and acceptance of us as Righteous.] By which words you may mean almost what your list; but how any man should understand your meaning that knows not your minde by some better discovery, I do not know. 1. Whether do you mean by [as much as concerns] an essential constitutive concernment, <hi>q. d.</hi> [as much as constituteth?] But if so, then you should exclude your transient act, and the immanent alone should not be [somewhat like Justification] but Justification it self. For if this imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent be as much as constituteth remission of sin, and acceptance of us as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Justification consisteth of these two only, then the immanent act is the whole of Justification. Or if you mean [as much as concerneth it antecedently <hi>ex parte Dei</hi>] that were manifestly false: For the giving of Christ, the accepting his Satisfaction and Intercession, and many other acts concerning Remission and Acceptance, are antecedent to Justification. Or if you should mean it in the full latitude, as your words import, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing concerneth our Remission and Acceptance but only Gods Decree, then it is yet more palpably false: but this is so gross that I may not suppose you guilty of it, though your unlimited words do seem to express it. Or do you mean [as much of Gods immanent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as concerns Remission and Acceptance is found in this Decree to pass the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient act,] supposing this to be part of our Justification, and the transient act the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135058:52"/> other part? But 1. your next words before and after seem to contradict that. For you say it is [a Decree to justifie] which therefore cannot be part of the thing Decreed. 2. And what mean you then to plead that it is [somewhat Like Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication] if it be a part, and such a part. Is it worthy a Divine laboriously to prove that a mans soul is Like a man? Or that [laying the Foundation] is somewhat Like to Building? The truth is, your terms perswade me either that you hold that Antinomian eternal Justification, which you are ashamed plainly to reveal, or else that you know not what you hold your self.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Yet do you repeat these ambiguous words again, as those, it seems, which best fit your design: and you prove them thus: [If it do not, then the Remission of sins, and Accepting of us as Righteous, are other immanent acts: but that cannot be:] Here you seem to explain your meaning of the former words, that it is [a constitutive concernment] that you spoke of: (but whether as the whole or as a part only I cannot tell.) For you say, that else these [<hi>are</hi> other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent acts] <hi>viz.</hi> [Remission and Acceptance <hi>are</hi> either Gods Decree, or other immanent acts.] But 1. why then do you make it your design to prove Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent act to be somewhat like Justification? Remission and acceptance of us as Righteous, are more then like it. Did not you say before [Justification is, by the consent of all Protestants, a Remission of sin and an acceptance of us as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? 2. Why did you before lay your proof no higher then this, [that every transient act <hi>supposeth</hi> an immanent, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Decree.] 3. It seems to me here that you assert eternal Justification in the definition, while you disclaim it as to name. 4. At least, you seem (if I can understand you) to maintain that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin and Acceptation of us as Righteous are from eternity. For you here import that these [<hi>are</hi>] Gods Decree, and you elsewhere say enough for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Decrees. But you knew, its like, that this is such gross Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, as that it was not for your credit openly to own it in the plainest terms. You give me not sufficient occasion here to stay long in confutation of this Error: yet briefly this I shall oppose. 1. He that was not a sinner from eternity, was not a pardoned sinner from eternity: (or, he that had no sin, had none remitted.) But you were not a sinner from eternity: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>minor:</hi> He that <hi>was</hi> not from eternity, was not a sinner from eternity: but you were not from eternity: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you say to the <hi>major,</hi> that it is enough to make us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Remission, that we were sinners <hi>in esse cognit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> I answer, either you speak <hi>de esse futuritionis,</hi> or <hi>de esse existentiae ut cognito:</hi> If of the former, the assertion is false: for [Future] is a term of Diminution, as to any true Being. An inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet man is not a subject capable of Remission of sin, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o nomine,</hi> because he will sin hereafter. If of the later, I say, God knows no man to be a sinner <hi>quoad existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam praesentem,</hi> that is not a sinner: Else he should know untruly. 2. Where there is no obligation to punishment there is no remission of sin. But on you or me there was no obligation to punishment from eternity: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is proved from the definition of Remission: which is A dissolution of an obligation to punishment. Where there's no obligation, there's none to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved thus: He that is not a sinner is not obliged to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: But you were not a sinner from eternity: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also <hi>Qui non</hi> Est, <hi>non est obligatus ad p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nam: At tu ab aeterno non fuisti:</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That which is undone in Time was not done from Eternity. But sin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned in Time, (<hi>viz.</hi> till we be united to Christ by faith, as Scripture abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly witnesseth:) Therefore it was not pardoned from Eternity. 4. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135058:53"/> no man as Righteous that is not Righteous (yea that is not) (for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth men as they are, and not as they are not.) But no man was Righteous from Eternity: Therefore God accepted none as Righteous from Eternity. But enough of that, till you speak more openly.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Your proof (that Remission and Acceptance are no other acts immanent but the Decree) is this: [For then either in the Understanding or the Will: but neither, <hi>&amp;c.] Ans.</hi> 1. I easily yield that Remission is no other immanent act; because it is none at all 2. But your proof seems none to me. You say, [Surely God cannot be said to Decree to know any thing, or to Decree to will any thing.] Your argument I think lies thus: [If God cannot be said to Decree to know or will any thing, then he hath no other immanent act but his Decree: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But here's no proof of the Consequence; which needs proof. God cannot be said to Decree to know himself (according to you; for I profess I am ignorant of these high mysteries:) Doth it follow that therefore he doth not know himself? I think not. Nor doth it follow that the knowledge of himself is only his Decree, as I hope you will easily confess. Moreover (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you) God cannot be said to Decree to know things to be Past. (For you say he cannot be said to Decree to know.) Yet I think God doth know, as his own Eternity, so our Time, and the Futurition, Presence, and Preterition of things in our Time: and therefore it doth not follow that he hath no knowledge of things, but his Decree. For his Decree (as now taken) is <hi>de futuris:</hi> but besides that God hath. 1. a knowledge <hi>de Praeteritis,</hi> and 2. <hi>de Praesentibus.</hi> You argue, from the Necessity of Gods knowledge and the Arbitrariness of his Decree: and many words you use which shew that confidence which I admire at: that you should pretend to be so far acquainted with the Divine Nature, as not only to ascribe to God the acts of man so far as you do, but to determine which acts are necessary, and which arbitrary, and that he cannot Decree to Know or to Will. I confess I am ready to tremble instead of replying, to think into what Mysteries you lead me so boldly. But I resolve no further to follow you, then to manifest your presumption, and to shew you that they are things unsearchable which you vainly pretend so well to know. Gods Knowledge is commonly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>simplicis Intelligentiae, &amp; Purae Visionis:</hi> The former is said to be in order before the Decree, and the later in order after it: therefore neither of them are taken for the Decree it self: and will you overthrow both by reducing all to the Decree? The knowledge of Vision is taken not to be necessary simply, but only on supposition of the Decree, which anteceding in order of nature doth cause the Intelligible objects. For, say they, it is by this Decree that things pass from the number of Possibles, into the number of things Future: and they cannot be known as future, till they are future; and they are made future Freely and not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily: therefore in the knowledge of Futures there is a freedom <hi>radicaliter &amp; participativè.</hi> And so it is no such hard or absurd concession, to say, God might not have known what he knows: as long as he might not have made it an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible object.</p>
               <p n="20">20. You next proceed to an objection, which you cast in your own way: and though I conceive you would not have made your self any work, but what you were confident you could honourably and easily dispatch, yet here I think it fals out otherwise. The objection is from our use of saying [Now we are justified in Gods sight.] Here 1. you say [This puts not a new act of knowledge in God] of which I have said enough before. 2. You tell us the sense of it: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:135058:53"/> that [It signifies only a Testimony given by God, whereby he makes us know that we are justified before God] and you say [Sight in God signifies a making us to see: and we are said to be justified in his sight, when he makes it, as it were, evident to our sight that we are justified.] This interpretation is to me something strange, and not easily received, both because of its Errour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you say so little to cover that Errour, but thrust so gross a conceit upon us upon your own authority. I rather think that the ascribing of such New acts to God, is 1. From the Moral Act of his Law, God being said to do that which his Law doth: and so he is said to judge us Righteous, when his Law of grace doth so judge us: and we are said to be Righteous <hi>in aestimatione Divinâ,</hi> when we are so <hi>in sensu Legis.</hi> 2. From the change of the object: For as the variety of objects denominateth Gods acts as divers, so on the same reason the Novity of the objects must denominate them as new, though they be immanent acts. 3. And by an Anthropopathie, Sight is oft put for Gods Remembrance or Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>But you thrust upon us pure Antinomian fancies. 1. If your conceits be true, then none is to be accounted [Justified in Gods sight] that do not see themselves to be justified; for you think [Sight in God, signifies a making us see.] Then wo to all those honest souls that see not themselves justified, nay rather think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves condemned: But yet if I discourse with such, I will venture to give them better encouragement, for all your doctrine; and to tell them [You may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in Gods sight, when you are condemned in your own.] 2. Shall we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use the Scriptures that use that phrase, and see whether all or any one of them can be understood as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> expoundeth them in the Antinomian way of <hi>Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Psal. 143. 2. <hi>For in thy sight no man be justified.</hi> Doth it mean, no man shall see himself justified? Jer. 18. 23. <hi>Forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight.</hi> Is that only meant of hiding the remission from their sight? or letting them know the <hi>non</hi>-forgiveness? Where the Scripture speaks so oft of <hi>doing that which is good in the sight of God,</hi> or <hi>that which is evil in his sight,</hi> Doth it mean Gods making us to see that it is good or evil? What is so good in the sight of sinners as that which is evil in the sight of God? Job 15. 15. <hi>The heavens are not clean in his sight.</hi> Job 25. 5. <hi>The starres are not pure in his sight.</hi> Is this sight of God a making the creature see? Heb. 13. 21. <hi>Working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight.</hi> Is this making us see? It were too long to recite all; if the Reader will peruse the rest, 1 <hi>Joh 3. 22. Exod. 15. 26. 2 Sam. 12. 9. 1 Chron. 19. 13. Psal. 72. 14. Hos. 6. 2. Rom. 3. 20. Mat. 11. 26. Luk.</hi> 10. 21. &amp; 15. 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 14. &amp; 51. 4. &amp; 9. 19. &amp; 5. 5 <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 3. &amp; 19. 19. or any other where this phrase is used concerning God, I leave it to his own judgement whether any one of them be taken in Mr <hi>K</hi>'s sense: That of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31. which he brings, is neither the same phrase, nor hath the same sense, and therefore is nothing to the matter. Yet is not Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s exposition of that satisfactory neither: For he cannot prove that it is meant meerly of discovering <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s heart to himself. It may be as much the discovery of it by the effects to others for their warning, and so shew the frailty of man: But the plain sense of the text referres that knowledge to God himself and not to any man; even by such an Anthropopathie which is ordinary in Scripture, as in <hi>Ezek. 12. 3. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious house,</hi> as if God had been in an uncertain hope of it. So <hi>Luk. 20. 13. Jer.</hi> 36. 3. So where God is said to repent. If God speak of himself to man after the manner of his own infirmity, must we therefore say, he means [our knowledge] when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth his own?</p>

If I thought it necessary, it were easie to heap up many more that are of the same minde. But I shall only in brotherly duty admonish Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to make more Conscience hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of false speaking: and seeing he hath read so very little, or lost it again, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humbly to acknowledge his Imperfection (as we that are guilty of the like must also do) then to make a confident vain-glorious ostentation of that which it seems by this, and many the like passages, he hath not.</p>
               <p>Let us adde some Reasons, that the Elicite acts may be the objects of other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite acts of the Will, and not the Imperate only, as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> saith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>Scotus</hi> argueth before from the proportion with the Intellect. A man may understand that he doth understand, by a reflect act: Therefore he may Will that he Will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is an apprehended Good may be Willed: But an Elicite Act of the Will may be an apprehended Good: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may Will his everlasting Happiness: (For if the End may not be Willed, what may?) But his everlasting Happiness consisteth partly in the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Acts of his own Will, everlasting to be exercised on God: [God being Objectively our Happiness) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c. Velle, Amare, Frui,</hi> are acts that must be perpetuated, and either may be Willed, or no man may will his own happiness.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatsoever is apprehended to be a fit means to this End or Happiness, may be Willed: But the Elicit acts of the Will may be apprehended a fit means hereto: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are commanded, and they are made Conditions of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and therefore are a means.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Effects of Gods special saving Grace on the soul may be Willed: But the Elicite Acts of the sanctified Will, are the Effects (and principal effects) of Gods special saving Grace on the soul: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That which a Christian may pray for, that he may and must Will: But he may pray for the Elicite Acts of a sanctified Will: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As he may pray, Lord, I Believe, help my Unbelief: So he may pray [Lord I am Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, make me more Willing, and hereafter Willing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Experience is in stead of a thousand arguments, I feel that my Willingness is the object of my unwillingness; and that in these several wayes. 1. I feel that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135058:55"/> upon the review of my past Willingness, and the sight of my present Willingness (in any Good) my Will hath a Complacency in it, which is a true <hi>Velle,</hi> yea the first and principal Elicite Act of the Will. 2. I finde that by a less perfect and intense Act, I do Will a more perfect Act. I am somewhat Willing, but I would fain be more Willing. Nay to procure the Amendment of my own heart by this increase of my Willingness (which is indeed the Increase of most of my Graces) is the main business of my life, committed to me by God, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by my self. And if I should cast off this great business, and neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire more Willingness or Grace, nor pray for more, nor labour for more, because Mr. <hi>K.</hi> out of his subtilty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ess me, that the Elicite Act is not the Wils object, I should be befool'd out of my Christianity and Salvation by a trivial trick of vain Philosophy. 3. I finde that by a present Act of Will, I do Will a future Act. I do Will now that I may also Will to morrow, and to my lives end, and for ever in glory, and that better then now I do. 4. I feel that I do Will a more sincere Willingness. I do Will Salvation with too much respect to my self in it, and too little to Gods honour. Now I would fain Will this more for God then I do. 5. I would fain Nill many things which through my corruption I now Will. 6. I would fain oft suspend a vicious act of my Will, at least. In all these respects, the Elicite Act of my Will is the object of my Will.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>K.</hi> will be Learned in despight of Natural and Gracious Experience (for I hope, for all his Learning, that he Would Love God more, as Love is taken for an act of the Rational part, and that he Wils a greater and a persevering, yea a perpetual Willingness of God and obedience; and a fruition of God, and <hi>frui</hi> is an act of the Will:) He will therefore prove what he once saith, and that's thus. [For what need of Willing to Will a thing, when one Willing is enough? And he that Wils to Will, Wils no more then he doth already, which is to Will: one of these acts must needs be superfluous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] To which I Reply; You may see in the several Instances which I gave before, that it is needfull, and that it is not superfluous, as you say, and that it is more then he did before; A more perfect act, a future act, a perpetuated act, are more then he did before. Yea its a doubt, Whether a very gracelesse man may not <hi>Velle intendere Deum, vel frui Deo</hi> yea strictly Will to Will God as his happiness, or to Will Holiness before Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousness, who yet doth it not already. And me thinks so acute a man might see that this is not the same act which he performeth already, for it hath not the same object. The man is Willing to be saved from Hell, but Unwilling to be Holy: He is convinced that he shall not be saved, unlesse he become Willing to be Holy: Therefore he wisheth he were Willing to be Holy: If this were but with a Velleity, it is yet an Elicite Act of the Will, but it may be called a Volition, though uneffectual, because there is a stronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will: So that it is <hi>Volitio quoad actum Absolutum,</hi> but <hi>quoad actum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratum,</hi> he is unwilling. The Object of that Will which he hath, is his <hi>Velle sanctitatem:</hi> the Object of that Will which he would have, is Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it self. If that <hi>Velle &amp; sanctitas</hi> be not all one, then these two Acts be not all one.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>K.</hi> confesseth at last that a man may be said to Will to be more Willing, but he saith [this is rather to Will a freedom from a disturbance of the sensitive appetite, then to Will the exercise of the rational Will.] But why is it that this man would not be disturbed by the sensitive appetite? Is it not because he would Will freely? Doth not he that Willeth the means, much more Will the End?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135058:55"/> And is not the Removal of the Impediment, a Means to your freer and more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense Willing? And do not you your self Will the increase of your Willingness upon the quieting of that Appetite? Besides, I hope you do not think that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the sensitive Appetite, is the onely Cause of our Imperfection in actual Willing: Or that our own Habitual Corruption and distemper of the Will it self, is not a greater Cause.</p>
               <p>After all this you conclude, that [it appears there is no new Immanent act in God required yea possible to the justifying of a man, besides his Decree to justifie.] To which I say, Though it little appear to me from any of your arguing, yet I easily yield to the Negative part of your Conclusion; and I say, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it self is no part of Justification, but an Antecedent.</p>
               <p>Again, Let it be observed, that all this arguing will as much prove that Gods Immanent act is like to Creation, Sanctification, Glorification, Damnation, or any thing that ever God did, as to Justification: For of all his Works it is as true, that he doth nothing but what he decreed to do. And so it may as well be said that our Glorification is an Immanent act from Eternity, as our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

               <p>Mr. K. <hi>MOre particularly, it will be as Evident that his Decreeing to Remit our sins, carries a Remission of them tantamount: For who shall charge them on us, where God decreeth to remit them?

                     </gap>, as for sins committed against his Crown and Dignity: Now where he hath decreed to remit those sins, there is no danger of suffering for them, let what ever accusers manage the Evidence against us, all that they can do is but this, to bring us to cry Guilty, and thereupon to appeal to God for Mercy; who upon our appeal to him for Mercy, he is graciously pleased to pronounce pardon to us. God himself I acknowledge also may charge them on us; and proceed in severity against us for a while; but this charge is not any way obstructive to his Decree to remit sin, but rather subservient to it, and to bring us to see and confess our sins, and cast our selves wholly on his Mercy in Christ, in which respect I might better say, that God doth shew love even in punishing unregenerate men that are Elect, then you did erewhiles, that he may be said</hi> to hate Godly men, <hi>when he punisheth or rather correcteth them: Punishment ayming chiefly at the satisfaction of Justice, Correction at the amendment of the offender.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135058:56"/> the conscientious Reader that loves Gods truth and his own Peace, consider by these few particulars following, what a Theology, nay what a Christianity this Learned man would introduce.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doth not this lead men to slight Christ and his sufferings, and to look on his Death as that which did them no great good?

               <p n="2">2. How small a matter is left for the Regenerate to receive upon their Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Believing in Christ, as to Remission of sins, when they are tantamount (I must use Mr▪ <hi>K</hi>'s School-term) remitted already?

               <p n="3">3. How small a matter is left for Baptism to seal and exhibit, as to Remission, when all sin was tantamount Remitted from Eternity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where is the Excellency and Glory of the Gospel, either as to the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Preceptive, or Promissory part? For the Narrative, it makes a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration how Christ was Promised, Incarnate, Born, how he Obeyed, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Satisfied, Merited, Rose, Intercedeth to procure a Remission which was tantamount done already even from Eternity.

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth man a way to obtain Remission by coming to Christ, and to maintain that Remission by abiding in Christ, when our sins were tantamount remitted from Eternity. The Promise seemeth to hold forth an excellent benefit, and all men are invited to Receive it; and when all's done, it offereth and promiseth to do that which is done tantamount already from Eternity. If you say, that yet Christ and the Gospel have their Excellency as they respect other benefits, <hi>viz.</hi> our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Glorification: I answer according to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s grounds, it must be said that these also were done tantamount from Eternity, in that they were Decreed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How small a matter have Christians daily to pray for, in that Petition [<hi>Forgive us our trespasses</hi>] when they were tantamount forgiven from Eternity? And what a spur is this to prayer?</p>
               <p n="6">6. How small a matter have they to Give Thanks for, as received through Christ from the promise, upon prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. How great a help doth this Doctrine give to Obedience, when men are told that all their sins are tantamount forgiven from Eternity?</p>
               <p n="9">9. How small a Difference between the state of the Regenerate and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, supposing them Elect? The sins of one are forgiven, and the other tantamount.</p>

And how hard to convince them of any such misery, when they have this Reply? Lay all this together, and see how much of our Religion and Christianity is left!</p>
               <p>But he proves all this by a Question [Who shall charge them on us where God decreeth to remit them?] I Reply, The same persons, and as many as might have charg'd them on us, if God had not decreed it. His Decree takes off no charge, nor disables any from charging us. It were not an Immanent Act, if it did <hi>ponere aliquid in objecto.</hi> 1. We are as much under the Charge, Curse, or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135058:56"/> Condemnation of the Law, till we believe, as if no such Decree had passed. 2. What the Law doth, God doth by it; for it is his Instrument. 3. Satan may charge us, 4. And so may conscience. 5. And men. But you confess your self that Conscience, Satan, and God may charge us▪ But you say [there is no danger] Reply. 1. What if you were to lie all your life in torment with the stone or gout, and yet were sure that you should die never the sooner, and so there were no danger? Would you think your self tantamount a sound man? Is it so small a matter in your eyes for an elect man to lie under the guilt of sin, and as an enemy to God till near his death, so be it he be not in danger of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 2. If you mean that their damnation is <hi>non-futura,</hi> I confess it: And so it would be if God should but fore-know it, and not decree it (supposing it might be the object of such a fore-knowledge.) 3. But yet I think it is not fit language to say [there is no danger of suffering for sins that God hath decreed to remit.] I see still whither Antinomianism tends. 1. If Christ did die to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from danger of suffering, then we were in danger of suffering: But Christ did die to deliver us from it: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Would you make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Christ saved us from no danger by his death? 2. The actual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Justification of the Elect, is a saving them from danger: Therefore they were in danger. 3. If the Elect unconverted are in no danger, then you must preach no danger to them, nor perswade them to avoid any, nor to repent the incurring of any: or if, because you know not the Elect, you speak to all of danger, you must tell them that you mean it not of the Elect: But what success such preaching would have, is easie to conjecture. 4.

Fear lest a promise being left of entring into his rest, any of you should come short of it.</hi> God bids us fear: Mr. <hi>K.</hi> tantamount bids us, Fear not, by telling us there is no danger. 5. Where men are bound to labour, run, strive, and use much means to escape danger, there is danger: But so God hath bound the Elect: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many Texts might be cited that binde us to save our selves, and seek our deliverance, and that speak of our escaping, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and salvation, which all imply a danger from which we escape, are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and delivered? 6. <hi>Matth. 5. 21, 22.

And he that was from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity Decreed to be pardoned, according to your Doctrine, was never in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 8. And then we ought to give no thanks to God the Father, or to Christ the Redeemer, or to the holy Ghost the Sanctifier, nor to any Preacher or other Instrument, for saving us from any danger of punishment. I think these are not matters to be made light of: nor that Doctrine of Libertinism to be cherished, which plainly leadeth to such unhappy fruits.</p>
               <p>But let us peruse your Reasons: You say [the charge is to be brought in Gods name.] Reply. So it may be nevertheless for the Decree; for that takes off none of the charge. You adde [All they can do is but this, to bring us to cry Guilty, and thereupon appeal to God for Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Reply. 1. Must they cry Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135058:57"/> and look for Mercy and Remission, that were tantamount forgiven from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? 2. Either you speak of an uncoverted elect person in this life; or else as supposing he were at Judgement in that estate. If the later be your meaning, then their Accusation might and would do more then you speak of, and would tend to condemnation (if such a case might be supposed.) If the former be your meaning, then these Elect persons do [Cry Guilty, and appeal to Mercy] with true Faith, or without it. If with Faith, then their sins are remitted further then by Decree, and these are not the persons now in Question. If without faith then they are not Forgiven for all this. As long as the Elect remain unregenerate, though that Law, and Satan, and Conscience accuse them, yet they do not Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly seek mercy: and if they were in that state at Judgement, it were too late to seek Mercy.</p>
               <p>Next you [acknowledge that God himself also may charge sin on us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in severity against us for a while; but this charge is not any way obstructive to his Decree to Remit sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Reply. God may be said to charge sinne on the Elect before faith. 1. By obliging them by his Law to punishment. 2. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting some small part of the punishment on them. You seem to me to take notice notice only of the later. But every Christian must acknowledge that for all Gods Decree, we are all <hi>Obligati ad poenam sempiternam,</hi> till we are united to Christ by faith. To say this is not obstructive to Gods Decree, is nothing to the question. The worlds being uncreated from Eternity, did not obstruct Gods Decree of making it, and the Elect's being unsanctified or unglorified doth not obstruct Gods Decree of Sanctifying and Glorifying them: and yet this proves not persecuting <hi>Saul</hi> was tantamount sanctified and Glorified. And what if God make the knowledge of our Damnable state, or our <hi>non</hi>-remission, a means to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? That doth not prove that we are before remitted in whole or in part, or tantamount.</p>
               <p>Whether you speak to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> or me, about the phrase of [hating the Godly] I know not: but if to me, I do not believe that ever I so spoke.</p>
               <p>Your distinction of Punishment from chastisement, is perverse: so learned a man should know, that Punishment is the <hi>Genus</hi> and Chastisement is a <hi>species</hi> of it. All Punishment is for the Demonstration of Justice; but not all for the satisfaction of Justice, Correction is as well for a Demonstration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as for Amending the Offendor: Else it were meer Affliction, and no Correction.</p>
               <p>Your Conclusion next laid down, much differs from the divers formerly laid down, and which you should have proved; and yet I have shewed, for part of this, how ill you have proved it: though, for my part, I know no Cause that I am engaged in that will be any whit prejudiced by yielding you all; as I easily yield you, that the Transient Act will certainly follow.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. NExt his Decree to Accept us, carrieth as much too; and there needs nothing but a Transient Act to prove his Acceptance, and evidence it to us: for to decree to look upon us as righteous, is not to look upon us as righteous in our selves, but his son; and to this looking on us, there needs no new immanent Act, beyond his electing us to faith in his Son, and perseverance in that faith: Thus he may be said to give us to his Son
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135058:57"/> before, and so then there is no new immanent act. Gods Remitting our sins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting us as Righteous, though they sound like Immanet acts, are to be sensed as Transient, and how shall be shewed next: in the</hi> interim <hi>this which hath been said is sufficient to shew, That in the Decree of God to justifie us, there is somewhat that looks like Justification; and no other immanent act in God is required to our Justification; besides his Decree from Eternity to justifie us in time.</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> I Shall never think the highest pretenders to exact explications to be the best performers, for your sake. You treat of Acceptance; but who can finde by all that you say, what you mean by [Acceptance.] You say, [Though it sound like an Immanent act it is to be sensed as Ttransient,] but what that Transient act is, for all your promises, I can hardly finde you discovering. Surely [to Accept] in our ordinary speech signifieth an Immanent act of the Will; but so you take it not; else must you yield that Immanent acts may be Decreed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, it may signifie the Moral action of the Law of Grace, which virtually judgeth the person Righteous, and its action is Gods action. But this you can less digest: and therefore what your [Acceptance] means, let him tell that knows. All that I can finde is, either that it is [the Giving of faith] or [the Making us know our Acceptance] of which more anon.</p>
               <p>You say [There needs nothing but a Transient act to prove his Acceptance, and evidence it to us.] <hi>Rep.</hi> Here is then but two Acts needfull: the one is [Decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Accept us as Righteous:] This is not Accepting, as the word and your own confession witness: The other is [a Transient act to prove and evidence his Acceptance.] This cannot be acceptance neither: For what man will say, that the evidence and proof is formally the same with the thing proved and evidenced? Is it all one [to Accept] and [to evidence and prove Acceptance?] What a maze do you run your self into under pretence of discovering the truth? You have fairly disputed [Acceptance] into Nothing.</p>
               <p>You adde [For to Decree to look upon us as Righteous, is not to look upon us as Righteous in our selves but in his Son.] <hi>Rep.</hi> To Decree to look, is not to Look: else you may say, it is a Decree to Decree. Your phrases of [in our selves] and [in his Son] may be so interpreted as to make your sense true; but if you mean that it is Christ only and not we, who is the subject of that relative Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which formally makes us Just, then it is false.</p>
               <p>You say [And to this looking on us, there needs no new Immanent act besides electing to Faith and Perseverance.] <hi>Rep.</hi> I pray you then tell us what you mean by [Looking on us:] an Immanent act it is not, you think: And is Gods [Looking on us as Just] a transient act? What act then is it? Did you say, That God is said to Look on us as Just, when his Law call us Just, I should not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with you: but you disclaim that. But I forgot that you did expound your meaning before upon [Gods seeing:] as Gods seeing is a making us to see, so its like you mean [Gods Decree to look on us as Just] is a Decree to make us Look on our selves as Just: and so the person is changed. But if this be your meaning, I had as lieve you said nothing.</p>
               <p>But I will tell you again, that if you will take [an Immanent act] <hi>formaliter</hi> for Gods essence, so there is none new, nor is there any more then one; Knowing, Willing and Nilling, Love and Hatred are all one. But if you will condescend
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:135058:58"/> to us of the simpler sort, and speak of Immanent acts as applied to God after the manner of men, and as his acts are <hi>formaliter,</hi> or <hi>modaliter,</hi> or <hi>relativè,</hi> or <hi>denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nativè,</hi> or however else (in a way unknown to us) distinct from his essence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o as they may be diversified among themselves without disparagement to Gods sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, they may also begin and end without disparagement to his Immutability, for any thing that you have yet said to the contrary. And so as they are diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or said to begin <hi>denominativè ex connotatione objecti,</hi> they may as well be said to be the objects of Gods eternal Decree. And thus I conceive, Decree respecting the future, and [Accepting and Approving] being acts that connote a present object, and so may not be said [to be such acts] till the object exist, therefore God may well be said to Decree to Accept us, and Approve us, and Love us, and Delight in us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though all be Immanent acts. And so my conclusion shall be contrary to yours, that you have not proved that there is no other Immanent act in God required to our Justification, besides his Decree; and if you had, yet you had done little to the business: And that you have no more proved [that in the Decree is something that looks like Justification] then that it looks like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Salvation, Damnation; And had you proved it never so strongly, I know not to what purpose it is. It is somewhat like God that is called his Image in his Saints: and yet he that cals the Saints, God, may blaspheme for all that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> VVHo your old Doctors are is utterly unknown to me; for I remember not that I have ever read any Doctor before you that goeth your way (if I know it) and am in hope that I never shall reade any such hereafter. For your not following me, as I have not been very eager to obtrude my opinions on any, so if it be no more for your own advantage then mine, I am not so desirous of your company, but that I can be without it. Now to the matter.</p>
               <p>I am very glad that I am come to a Controversie more easie and more usefull then that which you made and stuck in so long before. As for my opinion about the nature of Remission of sin, I have had occasion to view and review it since the writing of my Aphorismes, and have received Animadversions on this very Point of another nature then are these of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s, both for Learning, Sobriety, and Exactness of Judgement; and upon my most faithfull and impartial perusal of all, I must needs profess my self much more satisfied in my first opinion, and confident of its verity, then I was before: And some Learned men (as most <hi>England</hi> hath) do fully consent to it, and confirm it in their Animadversions; and I remember none of the rest (save the first-intimated Reverend Learned Brother) that doth contradict it, of all those Judicious excellent men that have vouchsafed me their private Animadversions. And even he doth confess all that action of the Law and change made by it, which I mention, as being a known truth beyond Controversie; only he thinketh that the name of Justification is to be given to no act but a Judicial Sentence, which I call, the most perfect sort of Justification. Indeed I am ashamed that I spake so strangely of so easie and familiar a Truth, as if it had been some new discovery, when all that are verst in Politicks and Laws may discern it to be so obvious: but the reason was, that I had not read any thing of it in Divines as to our present case.</p>
               <p>Before I come to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> let me tell the Reader my thoughts of Remission more fully. Pardon actively taken is an act of God. Passive pardon is the <hi>terminus</hi> or effect of that act. Pardon Active, is 1. Mentall, in a more imperfect, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and less-proper sense called Pardon: As when a Prince doth pardon a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour secretly in his own thoughts and resolution only. This is applied to God speaking after the manner of men (in which manner we are necessitated to speak of God:) and it is not (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> imagineth) to be conceived of by us as being the same with his Decree <hi>de futuro</hi> (so far as we may conceive of Gods Immanent acts as divers:) though it be but the same act that receiveth these divers denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135058:59"/> from▪ the diversity of the objects. 2. The second Active Pardon is Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Legal and Constitutive; which by signifying Gods Will, doth Legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute us pardoned, by causing our <hi>Jus ad Impunitatem vel Liberationem, i. e.</hi> by dissolving the Obligation to punishment, or by taking away guilt. The action or causation of this pardon, is but such as is that of every <hi>Fundamentum</hi> in causing its Relation. 3. Pardon taken actively also may signifie the very Grant of the act of Pardon (whether particular or general, absolute or conditional) that is, the act of Legislation (in our case) whereby the Law of Grace is formed, as the remitting Instrument. This goes before that forementioned; as being the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of that <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> which in time causeth the Relation aforesaid. 4. The Promulgation or Proclamation of this Law of Grace, or Act of Oblivion, may also be called Pardon. This Legal pardon is an Act of God as <hi>Rector supra Leges</hi> in respect to the old Law whose Obligation it dissolveth; and it is the Act of God as Legislator in respect of the Law of Grace which dissolveth the Obligation of the Law of Works.</p>
               <p>Accordingly Pardon in a Passive sense, is taken as many waies. 1. With men for the effects of mentall pardon in the heart and minde. 2. For the <hi>Jus ad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitatem,</hi> or the Dissolution of the Obligation to punishment, caused by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act. 3. For the Law of Grace, or the promise it self. And so the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Instrument of a King, is commonly called a Pardon. 4. For the hopefull Relation or state that he is in that hath pardon offered him on very easie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable terms (as for the Acceptance with thanks.) I think all these senses the word is used in the Scriptures; I am sure in Writers and common speech it is so. Now it is easie to discern that all the rest are but imperfect pardons, and so called in a diminute sense, except only the second, which is the full and proper pardon. 2. All this I speak of Pardon in Law sense, the same with that which I call Justification constitutive (or but notionally differing:) But besides all this there is Pardon and Justification <hi>per sententiam Judicis,</hi> which these are but the means to, and which is the most perfect of all. But note that as the word Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is most proper to [the sentence:] So the word [<hi>Pardon</hi>] is most proper to the Civil or Legal act that goes before Judgement. 3. And as God pardoneth 1. as <hi>Rector supra Leges</hi> by Donation and a new Law, 2. and as Judge by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: so 3. also as the executor of Law and sentence or his Will: And so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning is but Not-punishing. Where note 1. That this sometime may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and without the first, by meer providence: and so wicked men are pardoned without a promise, in such measure as God abateth and forbeareth punishing them. 2. That in our case this executive pardon <hi>quoad initium</hi> presupposeth the first Legal pardon, and <hi>quoad complementum</hi> it presupposeth the sentential absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. Note that this sort of pardon hath divers degrees, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of any due penalty which▪ is remitted: and so may alter. So that in a word, all pardon is of one of these three sorts. 1. By God as Author of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, giving Right to Impunity. 2. By God as Judge absolving. 3. By God as executing.</p>
               <p>All this being premised our question is, which of these it is that Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth to Faith, and is called Remission, or Believing, or Justification by Faith? Some say, It is only Gods mental pardon: Some say, It is none of these, but a Declaration to the Angels in heaven, who is Just. Some say, It is none of these, but a Manifestation to our consciences (as some speak) or a sentence of God in our hearts (as others speak.) Some say, It is <hi>ipsa Impunitas,</hi> or <hi>non Punire</hi> (as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135058:60"/>
                  <hi>Twisse</hi> sometime, or <hi>nolle Punire,</hi> as other times.) I think it is the Dissolving of the obligation to punishment, or the giving us a <hi>Jus ad liberationem vel ad impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> or Gods remitting his <hi>Jus puniendi:</hi> Where the immediate <hi>terminus</hi> is the Dissolution of the obligation, or our <hi>Debitum liberationis, vel jus ad impunitatem:</hi> and the remote <hi>terminus</hi> (which is yet connoted in the term Pardon, as essentially necessary) is Impunity it self, or actual liberation from punishment, or <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punire.</hi> And withall, as in man a mentall Remission goes before the actual Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Legal Remission, so there is in God, a <hi>Nolle punire,</hi> and after the manner of men, it may be ascribed to God, as then beginning when the Law remitteth, and the sinner is a capable subject, because it cannot be denominated Remission, but by connotation of the object, and that must be, when there is an object fit: And so after the manner of men, we attribute it to God, as an act which in time he is moved to by an Impulsive cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Satisfaction and Merits of Christ: though strictly we use to say, there is nothing <hi>ab extra</hi> can be an impulsive cause to God: Much more then this I have said for explication of this Point in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Papers to some Learned Friends; but this may suffice for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of what here passeth between Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and me. And now I proceed to his words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He acknowledgeth the Promulgation of the New Covenant to be a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient act: It is the same Instrument of God that is called his Covenant and his Law here. And as it is a Law, the term [Promulgation] doth most fitly agree to it. And I doubt not but either Mr. <hi>K.</hi> implieth Legislation (perhaps he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes the terms for equipollent) or at least he will as freely acknowledge that a Transient act. But he saith, 1. That [this Covenant hath an odde empty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall action.] Let any man that reades these words of this Learned man, judge whether I be not excusable for that censure in the Preface to the Appendix of my Book of Baptism! A School Divine and a Chair man, and know no more the nature of a Law, Covenant, or any Legal Instrument! A Divine, and an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus,</hi> and yet dare to speak such words of all the holy Laws and Covenants of God! Why what doth this man study and preach, that thinks so basely of Gods Laws? The Moral action of the Law of Grace or Testament of Christ he calleth [an odde empty Moral action:] Yet its like he knows that Commonwealths are chiefly upheld and ordered by Laws, Contracts, Conveyances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by actions of the same nature. The whole body of the Commonwealth and each member of it, do hold their Estates, Liberties and Lives by such odde empty actions. Take away the odde empty Moral action of Laws, Testaments, Obligations, Deeds of Sale, Leases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what is a Commonwealth, and what a Rector, and what security have you of any thing you possess? or what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly commerce among men? His next assertion is as desperate as the former, that [by the promulgation of this Covenant, God doth as improperly give us the Righteousness of Christ, or disable the Law to condemn us.] Could any words (not certainly destructive to Christianity it self) have fallen from this Learned man more unworthy a Divine? Doth not the Testament of the Lord Jesus properly convey the Legacy? Doth not Gods Deed of gift of Christ and his Righteousness to us, properly convey? and doth not God properly Give thereby? Why how can a more proper way of Giving be imaginable? 1. If a man do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly give, by a Testament or Deed of Gift, then so doth God: But a man doth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Where there is a plain signification of the Will of the Donor to confer thereby the benefit on the Receiver, there is a proper Giving:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135058:60"/> But in the Gospel-promise or Testament of Christ there is such a signification of the Donors Will: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth not an Act of Oblivion or Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly give pardon to all that it pardoneth? Doth not any Act of Grace give the favours expressed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And where he saith, that [God doth hereby as improperly disable the Law to condemn us▪] I Reply. 1. Nothing in the world can more properly disable the Law from effectual condemning us, that is, so as to procure sentence and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, then a general Act of pardon, or then the new Law doth, which is in its very nature <hi>Lex Remedians, &amp; obligationem ad paenam prioris dissolvens.</hi> Though still the Law as to its sense is the same, and therefore doth virtually condemn till the said dissolution. How can the Law of the Land be more disabled from effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual condemning all Traytors, for what is past, then by an Act of Oblivion, or a particular pardon under the Soveraigns Hand and Seal? 2. Yea this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man disputes against the very formall nature and definition of a pardon: which is to be <hi>an Act of the Rector freeing the guilty from punishment by dissolving the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> And certainly as the obligation it self is one of these [odde, empty Moral actions,] so must the dissolution of it needs be. Indeed <hi>Theologus est Jurisconsultus Christianus,</hi> a Christian Lawyer: and what a Lawyer he is that knows not the nature, use and force of Laws, is easie to be judged. I could wish men would lay by their over-bold enquiries into Gods Decrees and other Immanent acts, or at least, their vain pretendings to a knowledge which they never had of them, and study this intelligible and necessary part of Theology a little more.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>K.</hi> tels us that he will make all this strange doctrine [appear:] and how? Why [by considering that all here spoken of actions, is but of actions improperly so called, and such as cannot suffice to make a real effect.] <hi>Rep.</hi> Do you oppose [Real] to [feigned or nominal] or to [Relative?] If the former, it is such doctrine as I dare say, no Divine will believe, no Lawyer, no understanding member of a Commonwealth, and I think, no Christian, that understandeth what you say. Think not the words rash, for I think him not fit to be accounted a Divine, no nor a Christian (supposing him to understand the matter) that will or dare main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That neither the curse of the Law, or threatning of the new Law, whereby so many are adjudged to Hell, nor yet the Testament, Covenant, Promise of the Gospel, whereby Christ and his Benefits, Justification, Adoption, Salvation (<hi>quoad Jus</hi>) are given, do any of them make a true change? But if you oppose [Real] to [Relative,] then I must tell you, that [Remission and Justification Passive] are no Real effects, but Relative; which I had thought you need not have been told. The act of Legislation and Promulgation makes a real effect; but the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> once laid, causeth but a relation. Do not you know that the very formal nature of all morality is Relative? What else is <hi>Aequum, Justum, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum, Debitum, Jus,</hi> yea <hi>bonum morale, &amp; malum,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Again I must tell you, that you do not well to mention <hi>Promulgation</hi> alone, when I spoke of Enacting, or Granting, or Legislation, before Promulgation. I hope you take not both these for one. Nay indeed Promulgation is proper to a Law as it is obligatory to the subject, and so is necessary after Legislation, <hi>ad actualem obligationem:</hi> but a Law of Grace which doth conferre benefits, and whereby the Legislator doth, as it were, oblige himself, may be in force in some degree, without a Promulgation: because a man may be made capable of Right to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit without his knowledge, though he cannot be obliged to duty without his knowledge, except when he is Ignorant through his own fault.</p>

But little thanks is due to this Authour from the friends of Truth, for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the way of the Covenants Justifying. [It is (saith he) by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, as a Law:] True: How else should it be? [but not Agent] Not by a Physical proper Action: that's true: But have Laws, Testaments, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Grants, Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Moral Action?

Is it the Covenant <hi>quod explicat, quid sit Justificatus?</hi> Or by which <hi>Justus est id quod est?</hi> But let us make the best construction imaginable of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>K</hi>'s words, and suppose that he would only prove the Negative [what way it is by which the Covenant justifieth not, <hi>viz.</hi> not <hi>efficienter</hi>] and not [what way it doth Justifie, <hi>viz. formaliter</hi>] yet I should demand, 1. What is then the use or purpose of his Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or fore-going words? 2. What the better are we for his discourse, if he tell us not what way it is? 3. What Cause will he make it if not an efficient? Will he say it is either Material or Final? I think not. But he saith, that [the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth not Justifie a Believer by any Act, let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mince it as he will, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Improper Action, but as his great Metaphysical Rabbies would speak, <hi>aptitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaliter,</hi> and this but <hi>extrinsecè</hi> too.] Reply. What Reader is much the wiser
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135058:61"/> for this answer? Would you know whether <hi>Foedus facit Justum, ut forma, vel ut efficiens?</hi> Why Mr. <hi>K.</hi> telleth you, it doth it but <hi>aptitudinaliter?</hi> If so, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, not <hi>ut forma:</hi> for <hi>forma aptitudinalis faciens informatum,</hi> is a strange crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It must then be matter or efficient. I would not think so hardly of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> as to imagine that he takes it for a Material Cause; much less that he takes it for <hi>Materia aptitudinalis Justificationis actualis.</hi> I hope such doctrine never dropt from his Chair. What is left then, but that it be an efficient. And if so, is not all efficiency by Action of one sort or other? And moreover, how comes <hi>Efficiens tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Aptitudinalis,</hi> to be <hi>Efficiens Actualis?</hi> And if not <hi>Actualis,</hi> how comes the Effect to be produced, <hi>viz.</hi> The Believer to be Justified? But I dare not impute this <hi>non</hi>-sense to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Perhaps he takes the Covenant to be no Cause at all of Justification? But that will not hold neither? For he plainly saith, that [the Covenant justifieth] twice here together. And sure <hi>Justifying</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth some Causation.</p>
               <p>Yet the amuseth me more by adding [and this but <hi>extrinsecè</hi> too.] Why, who is it that hath found out another Justifying efficient, But onely the extrinsecal? By this I see he takes it not for Matter or Form; for they are not extrinsecal. But is not the Law, the Jury, the Advocate, the Judge, each of them an extrinsecal efficient in justifying every man that is justified <hi>in soro humano?</hi> It may be Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath respect to the justification of Conscience: But doth he think that there are not extrinsick efficienrs, that do more properly and more nobly justifie then our consciences do? Then let man be his own pardoner and justifier, and be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the bloud of Christ, the Law, the Advoeate, and the Judge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. I think it is no disparagement to our Glorious Judge, that he will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us extrinsecally. Conscience which justifieth (in some sense) intrinsecally, doth it by so low an Act, by so small Authority, that it is very doubtfull whether it be fit to call that Act either Constitutive or sentential Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, so great is the Impropriety: (Of which I have spoke more fully elswhere.)</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had named some of those Metaphysical Rabbies, and been guilty of naming as it were the Chapter and Verse (of which crime he accuseth me) I should the better have known whether he say true or false, when he tels us that they would say the Covenant justifieth <hi>aptitudinaliter,</hi> and not by any act. Its true that the Covenant justifieth, <hi>Ʋt signum voluntatis Divinae per hoc Peccata re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittentis:</hi> And had he said that it is <hi>Signum Aptitudinale</hi> to men before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and <hi>Signam Actuale</hi> after, there had been some sense in his words, though yet they had been defective of Truth or Fitness: For they are <hi>signum actuale</hi> to mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the unjustified, though not <hi>signum actualiter Justificans.</hi> But it is Believers that are actually justified, of whom he speaks expresly: and therefore he hath some other meaning, what ever it is.</p>
               <p>Yet if Mr <hi>K.</hi> had denied to the Covenant in justifying, a proper Physical act only, we were agreed; But he denieth [an improper moral action] as he tels me, I mince it: which if I should do, I should expect to be told, that I were a very singular man indeed: For I doubt not but this Learned man hath read many a large Volume of Politicks, and particularly <hi>de Legibus,</hi> and there read their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses <hi>de Legum acttonibus,</hi> viz. <hi>praecipere, prohibere, praemiare, punire:</hi> I doubt not but he hath read many a large Volume of the Civil Law in special, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the Nature of Obligations of all sorts: (For I would not suppose him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in his reading of any thing.) And after all this for so Orthodox a man to deny [a Moral improper action] to Gods Laws, and so to all Laws, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135058:62"/> therein differ from all the Lawyers and Divines that ever the world knew (so farre as I can learn) is singularity indeed! Yea and never yet to write one Volume of his Reasons against all the world, that we might be undeceived? Seriously I wonder what he thinks of Gods Laws, Covenants, Promises, Testament, and how he preacheth them, yea or believeth them, or what work they have on his soul, who takes them to have no Moral improper Action? I should think such a <hi>merus Physicus</hi> were a strange man to make a Divine. But let us hear his reason: [For <hi>Foedus non facit justum</hi> of it self, but it must be beholden to many interveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Causes] Reply. 1. It seems to be here granted that <hi>Foedus facit justum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venientibus alijs Causis:</hi> And if so, it is an efficient; and if so it hath some kinde of Action. 2. <hi>Negatur sequela:</hi> What if the Covenant justifie not <hi>nisi intervenientibus aliis quibusdam Causis?</hi> Doth it thence follow that it hath no moral Action? And we must speak <hi>non</hi> sense to say, that it justifieth but <hi>Aptitudinaliter?</hi> 3. I deny that there is any other Cause doth intervene between the Covenant, and the Effect. A Condition on mans part must be performed before the Law or Covenant of Grace will <hi>Actu Causare,</hi> i. e. <hi>Justificare.</hi> And this Condition hath its Causes: But Remission and Justification have no intervening Causes.</p>
               <p>I have in Answer to other Reverend Brethren so fully and distinctly laid down my own thoughts of this whole business, <hi>viz.</hi> of the several sorts of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of the nature of each, and the Causes, that I will suppose I may be excused that I do it not here. Only I may tell Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that I take Righteousness as now in Question, to be a Relation (whether predicamental or Transcendental, we will not now dispute; but I suppose it is the later.) And as Relation is so small or low a Being, that it is by some reckoned between <hi>Ens &amp; Nihil,</hi> so the way of its production must be answerable; and must be by as low a kinde of Action. Yet if it have any kinde of Being at all, it must have some Cause, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must have some Action. And therefore Rabbi <hi>Keckerman</hi> saith, <hi>Fundamentum idem sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat quod Efficiens; Terminus idem quod finis.</hi> I suppose Mr. <hi>K.</hi> will acknowledge the Causation of procatarcktick Causes, <hi>objectum, occasio, meritum:</hi> and yet will finde these efficients to have but an improper Action (at least some of them) as well the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> hath in causing a Relation. Besides all this, it is found no easie matter to reduce all Politicall Notions to the Notions of Logick or Metaphysicks; and some think that when we speak of Politicks, we must speak in the terms of Politicks, and that it is an unfit or impossible attempt to speak there in the strict language of Logicians, though I am not of their minde in the later.</p>
               <p>But suppose that I had granted all that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath hitherto said: What is it to that which he shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d prove? He undertakes to prove, 1. That the Covenants Action (as I call it) is [an odde, empty, Moral Action] and so cannot make this Effect: But he hath not yet proved, that the Relation of our Righteousness may not Result from the Covenant as its <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> though without a proper Action; as soon as the Condition is performed on our parts to make us fit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 2. He undertakes to prove, that [by the Promulgation of this Covenant God doth as improperly give us the Righteousness of Christ, and disable the Law to condemn us, because all here spoken of Actions, is but of Actions improperly so called] But doth he indeed think that Legislation, or Promulgation, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant making is but Improperly called Action? If he do, I will not waste time in such a work as the Confuting him is.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:135058:62"/>
               <p>Lastly, If his Argument be good [We are not properly justified by an Action improperly called Action: But the Action of the Covenant is Improperly called Action: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] then it will follow that we are not properly Justified by any Action of God. For it is generally held, that [Action] is not properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to God, but Analogically, and after the manner of the creature. I think this first Argument of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> deserves no more answer.</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. EIther you mean, that [it is not by the Transient act Alone that God Justifies] or [not by it at all.] If the former, I confesse it, because the Moral Act which followeth doth intervene to the production of the Effect. It is not by the transient Act of Generation <hi>alone,</hi> that <hi>Pater causat filiationem.</hi> But it seems you take it in the later sense, and so it is false. Though the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> do <hi>suo modo Causare Relationem, idque immediate,</hi> yet that Act which Causeth the <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> doth properly Cause the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I seriously profess that it seems to me a very sad Case, that any man that is called a Divine, or a Christian should argue, and that so weakly, and so wilfully against all the efficacy of Gods Testament, Law or Covenant in conveying to us the saving Relative benefits of Christ! If it were only (as some Divines that I deal with) that he acknowledged the thing, and denied onely the fitness of the Name of Justifying to the Act of the Covenant, it were a smaller matter: But it is Remission of sin it self; the giving us Christs Righteousness, the disabling the Law to condemn us, that he speaks of, as you may see before: and so he here dares to conclude, That God justifies none by it. To this lamentable <hi>Dilemma</hi> here brought for proof, I say, 1. <hi>Conditionally</hi> God Justifieth <hi>All</hi> by his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, at least All to whom it is Revealed. <hi>Actually</hi> he Justifieth only them that have the Condition. I oppose <hi>Actually</hi> to <hi>Conditionally,</hi> because that while it is but <hi>Conditional,</hi> it is not <hi>Actual</hi> in Law sense, that is, Effectual, though it is <hi>in Actu,</hi> so farre done as it is: And indeed it is not in strict sense that a man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Justified, while it is but Conditional: though yet it is a common phrase, because the Agent hath done it <hi>quantum in se,</hi> when the Condition is but Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. God doth Justifie some more then others by his Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers more then Unbelievers: This me thinks a Divine should not have denied. But he hath reason for his denial: and what's that? Why, he saith [for the New Covenant makes no difference of it self.] A strong Reason: It doth it not of it self: Therefore it doth it not at all. But I Reply: There is a two-fold difference made between men in these spiritual changes. The first is Real, when one that was an Infidel is made a Believer: and this is done by the Spirit and Word ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; and it is but to prepare men to be fit objects for the justifying Act: The second is Relative, when we are Pardoned, Justified, Adopted, and have a Right
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135058:63"/> given us to other Benefits: This difference the Covenant makes of it self, the former preparatory difference being before made. To say, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant makes not the first Real difference; Therefore it makes no difference, is ill arguing.</p>
               <p>I would desire the Reader to try how Mr. K's argument will fit the Laws or Conveyances of men. If a Parent bequeath to each of his children an hundred pound on Condition they marry, to become due at the day of Marriage; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. K. you may argue thus: Either this Testament Giveth the Legacy to All, or to None: Not to All, if All marry not: Not to some above others: for the Testament of it self makes no difference: Therefore it Giveth it to none. Or if a King give out a Pardon, or passe an Act of Pardon or Oblivion for all Traitors that are up in arms against him, on Condition that they lay down arms, and Accept the pardon: Mr. K. would argue, it seems thus: Either this Act pardoneth All, or Some: Not All: for All will not lay down Armes, and Accept it: Not Some onely; for the act makes no difference of it self: Therefore it pardoneth none.

There is a service which is <hi>operari,</hi> or some way profitable to him that we perform it to; which therefore may oblige by commutative Justice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us: and here the Reward is not of Grace, but Debt; and the Work is a Meritorious Cause, properly so called. There is a Work which is a Means of Moral-natural Necessity (on terms of Reason and common honesty) to our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly participation of a Benefit freely Given: As if a Traitor shall have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135058:63"/> on Condition he will Accept it, and come in: Or as if a Woman▪ Traitor should not only have pardon and life, but also be Princess, on condition she will marry the Kings son, that hath Ransomed her. Here the act may improperly be called service, because Commanded: but properly and in its principal Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a necessary reasonable means, to her own happiness: And this act is but a meer Condition <hi>sine qua non,</hi> of her Pardon and Dignity, and no proper Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or efficient Cause.</p>

                  </gap>each men proudly to thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their pardon and happiness, and deny God the thanks! To say [Gods promise would have brought me never the nearer the reward, had not I believed: and I did a great deal more to Justifie my self by Believing then God did by his Covenant.]</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay, I would desire the Reader to observe, what shift Mr. K. hath left for himself to disclaim this wicked Conclusion: Is there any of the Premises which he doth not own? 1. I hope he will not deny but the Promise of pardon and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is made to all that hear it, on Condition, they will Repent and Believe: 2. If he regard not better proof, I hope he will believe Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> (so oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) that salvation is given <hi>per modum praemii.</hi> 3. I hope he believes, that without believing, the Covenant would not have brought him to salvation. Must not this man then conclude on his own principles, that [he wisely justifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by believing? and more a great deal then God doth justifie him by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the new Covenant, which would have left him in his old Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had he not better provided for himself by Believing, then the Covenant did by promising.] I am loth to give those words so bad an Epithete as is their due. Why may not any Traitor say the like that Receives a free pardon? Or a beggar that Receives a free alms, when Receiving or Accepting is the Condition <hi>sine qua non</hi> of their attaining and possessing it?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Gospel hath a promise of Faith it self to some: and this Faith is Caused by the holy Ghost: Therefore it is still God that provideth for the Elect, better then they provide for themselves, howsoever such disputers may talk. But we must not therefore confound the nature of Gods Gifts, nor their Causes or way of production. The Spirit gives us Faith first, which is our Condition, and makes us capable objects or subjects of Justification: which being done, the new Law of Grace doth immediately Pardon, Justifie and Adopt us: which way then doth Mr. K's desperate consequence follow? Or what shew of ground hath it? It seems if this man had forfeited his life, if a pardon were offered him but on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he would Take it, and say, I thank you; he would say, he did a great deal more to his own pardon by Thanks and Acceptance, then the King that granted it, did by his Grant; because the Grant would have left him in the old Condition, had he not better provided for himself by Thankfull Acceptance, then the King did by his Pardon.] Yea and in our Case the Acceptance is Given too, though another way. I confess my detestation of this disputing, is beyond my expression.</p>

Now when the Queen and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were dead, they had no power to oblige them that should live after them, much less if contrary to the Will of their successors: Nor yet had they power while they were alive, so to binde posterity. The Laws therefore were divolved into other hands, and now bindes as <hi>signum voluntatis Rectoris jam existentis:</hi> For it is his will that it should continue; and that will animates it: Yet where any hath power, the signs of their will may be effectual when they are dead: Or else Testaments were little worth, and Legataries were in an ill case. But whats this to our case? God dieth not, and the Laws of his Kingdom lose not their force, nor change their Master, by the change of Governours. But if you had dealt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, you should rather have enquired, whether the present Rector and Master of the Law, may be said to condemn him that the Law condemns. And that methinks you should not deny. Yea, and it may be said that dead <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> was a cause of the condemnation of surviving offendors, for all your bare deniall.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Yet <hi>Appello Jurisconsultos:</hi> and if they say not that it is a more proper speech to say [The Judge condemneth him] then to say [He condemned himself by breaking the Law] then I am content the next time its acted to take <hi>Ignoramus</hi> his part, and confess that I know little of the Lawyers language. Indeed I still say it is the offendour that is the culpable cause.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. YOu say, [It is a like matter.] But you say so much and prove so little, that you lose much of your labour, as to me. It is not a like matter. The Law for saving him that reads <hi>ut Clericus,</hi> was made partly to spare Learned men, because the Prince or Commonwealth hath need of them, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth a greater loss in the death of such then of the unlearned; and partly in a respect to the worth of their Learning, if not with some special indulgence to the Clergy for their Office, and to please the Pope. But Gods Law of Grace pardoning a penitent, gracefull Believer, hath no such intent: God needs not us, as the Commonwealth needs the Learned. Besides the Law hath laid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of escape in intellectual Abilities, without any Moral respect to the virtue of the party: but God hath laid it more in the meer consent of the Will▪</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if you will interpret the Law of the Land otherwise, as if it were an act of purest grace, then I say, your Client with his <hi>Gramercy</hi> is an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fellow, and your bad Englishman, is the picture of a bad Christian, indeed no Christian: But by your speeches I perceive that about these matters experience is a great advantage to the right understanding of the Truth; by the means whereof many an unlearned Christian knows more then some Learned Disputers. He that hath felt what it is to be condemned by the Law, and afterward pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gospel, and put into a state of salvation by Christ, doth not say as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that he is more beholden to his believing then to Gods promise, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ascribeth all to God. Faith is the act of an humbled soul accepting of Christ as he is offered in the Gospel. And can any humbled soul give thanks to his own Acceptance, more then to Gods Gift? yea when the power and act of Accepting is his Gift also? If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> have an imagination that in every conditional Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is more thanks due to the performer of the condition then to the giver, I dare say, he is an ungratefull person to God and men. If his father leave him all his Estate on condition he give a younger Brother 6<seg rend="sup">d</seg> out of it, or that he give 6<seg rend="sup">d</seg> to the poor; it seems he will more thank himself then his father. If he had forfeited his life, and a pardon were given him, on condition he would Accept it thankfully and humbly on his knees, and that he would not spit in the face of him that giveth it, nor seek his death, he would give the chiefest thanks to himself. As for the phrase of [saving himself] he knows it is the Scripture phrase, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>

Its a hard case that a man so Learned in his own eyes should be ignorant what a Condition is, <hi>in sensu Civili, vel Legali.</hi> Were you not so, you would not still make it a cause; when (unless somewhat beyond the meer nature of a Condition be added) it is no cause at all.

And if it still stick in your stomack, that he performeth no new act to do this; I answer, it needs not: the first act of making his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Deed of gift, Contract, Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth all this. The Law or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, is but the signifier of his Will, and therefore conveyeth when and on what terms he will (in a case within his power.) If it be his will that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument shall <hi>Jus</hi> conferre presently and absolutely, it doth it: If but <hi>in dicu</hi> and absolutely, it doth it: If <hi>sub conditione,</hi> it doth it: and in both the last cases, its his will that the Instrument shall give no Actual Right till the day come, or till the Condition be performed▪ so that a Condition is no true cause of the effect: the <hi>non</hi>-performance of it suspendeth the act of the grant, but the performance doth not cause it; unless you mean it of a <hi>causa fatua,</hi> which doth but <hi>removere impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum;</hi> so that if the Day be twenty years after the Testators death, that the Legacy becomes due, or if the Condition be so long after performed, it is the will of the Donor that maketh that Instrument then convey Right, which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; because it works only <hi>significando voluntatem Donatoris,</hi> and so when and how he expressed his will it should work. Would one think such trivial obvious points should be unknown to Mr. <hi>K.?</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. THe man would have his Reader believe that I must be forced by his Arguments to confess faith to be a real effect. 2. Till he prove it, I will take it for a meer slander, that I deny Faculties and Habits distinct from the soul. 1. I said I thought [it would not be proved,] but I rose not to the confidence of a flat deniall; as knowing what is said on both sides. 2. What was it that I said would not be proved? That the faculties were not <hi>Really distinct</hi> from the soul or one another: but not that they were not <hi>distinct,</hi> as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> saith. They may be distinct modally or formally, though not <hi>ut Res &amp; Res.</hi> 3. When did I say this of Habits, as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> affirmeth? But I will hereafter expect no more truth from him, even in matters of fact, then according to the proportion of the foregoing dispute. 4. To the point it self I say, we must distinguish of Reality: If you oppose Real either to Feigned, or Privative, or Negative, or Potential, or to an extrinsecall denomination, or to meerly Relative, so its out of doubt that faith and all graces in the act and habit are Real effects. But if by Real you mean more then a distinction formall, or <hi>Ratione Ratiocinata,</hi> or Modal, I will neither affirm nor deny it, till I better understand it: You that know so well the nature of the Immanent acts of God, may a thousand times more easily know the nature of the Immanent acts and habits of man: but I confess exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ignorance of both: and to tell you my opinions of these things would be but vain and unseasonable. 5.

Let the Reader remember, that the thing which I deny is, that faith is an Instrument
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135058:67"/> in the strict Logical sense, that is, an Instrumental efficient cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and that I expresly disclaim contending <hi>de nomine,</hi> or contradicting any that only use the word Instrument in an improper larger sense, as Mechanicks and Rhetoricians do: so that the Question is <hi>de re,</hi> whether it efficiently cause our Justification as an Instrument? This I deny. And to his triple Answer I Reply. 1. The first is of the old stamp; a gross untruth, needing no other reply then a deniall. 2. The second if it be sense, implieth the deniall of this maxime, that [<hi>Instrumentum est efficientis principalis Instrumentum</hi>] and thence inferreth, that [as man may be his own Instrument in effecting faith, though he be not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause, so may he be in Justification of himself.] If this be not the sense of it (if contradictions may be called sense) then I cannot understand it. But the denied maxime needs no proof: that man is his own Instrument in effecting his faith, needs no more then a deniall to disprove it (speaking thus <hi>de homine,</hi> and not <hi>de parte aliqua hominis organicâ.</hi>) That man is not <hi>causa principalis</hi> in beleeving, is untrue; though God be <hi>Causa prima:</hi> May none but the <hi>Causa prima</hi> be called <hi>Causa principalis?</hi> then no creature is capable of using an Instrument. 3. His third must be considered when we come to the fuller proof which he referres us to.</p>

For the first I will appeal to all Lawyers and Politicians, or any that understands what an Instrument is, what Civil commerce is, and what a Law or any Contract is, whether a Deed of gift, a Testament, or a Law be not as proper Instruments <hi>conferendi Jus, constituendi Debitum,</hi> as is imaginable,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135058:68"/> or as the nature of the thing constituted or conferred (<hi>Debitum</hi>) is capable of. In the mean time, I leave Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to examine it, by the common Canons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of an Instrument. 2. Faith is not [Gods pronouncing,] but your belief of what he pronounceth, and Acceptance of what he offers: Will you confound faith with its object? Divine Testimony is the object of faith, and you make it faith it self. 3. I know the Antinomians take faith to be [the belief of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: or the perswasion or apprehension of Gods love to me in special,] but so do not our modern Protestants. 4. If this be true doctrine, then wo to poor Christians that have no Assurance of their Justification: and then, how few have faith? For I think it is comparatively but a small number that have felt God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing in their hearts, that the Covenant is of benefit to their own particular Justification: except by the term [of benefit] be meant, a conditional Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a tendency or means towards their Justification; and so even ungodly men may know that it's [of benefit] to them for Justification (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it.) 5. Doth not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> shew here that the Truth sticks in his minde, and that he is fain to hide it in ambiguous terms. What can he mean by this saying [God pronounceth the New Covenant to be of benefit to me for my Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] but this [That the New Covenant justifieth me?] He would not openly tell us which way it benefiteth him to Justification, and yet be no efficient instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cause of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. ANd 3. it may be Gods Instrument notwithstanding his Argument: whereof the first is [for it is not God that believeth] nor needs it, say I: it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God maketh me believe, and so receive the Righteousness of Christ: yea God by making me believe gives me an hand wherewith to receive, opens my hand whereby I receive it: I alone receive, but these are Gods acts, and though God be not said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he truly may be said to be the Authour of my belief; my belief is an immauent act in me, and so denominates me the believer, a transient act as from God, and denominates him only the Authour of my believing: in me it is an adjunct, it hath to him only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of an effect. For example, I throw a bowl: the motion of this bowl is more from me then the bowl, and I accordingly am said to have bowled well or ill: but the motion doth not denominate me otherwise then in the Agent, not the subject; and though I be said to bowl well, the bowl in this case is only said to run, not I. So the chief Authour of my Believing is God, and he must have the glory of turning and framing and upholding and working all in my heart, as being the Authour, Preserver and Finisher of my faith, yet I alonc am said to believe, not God; though my faith be more properly Gods work, then it is my own: had not he begun it in me, I had no more believed in Christ, then the bowl would have run to the mark of it self; all the progress of my faith is from him, and to him be all the glory.</hi>

Mr. Baxters <hi>second Argument to prove it, not Gods Instrument that man is</hi> Causa secunda <hi>between God and the Action, and so still said to justifie himself. I answer, 1. Man is indeed</hi> Causa secunda, <hi>but not between God and the Action, for God doth immediately concurre to it, and man is in regard of the habit of faith purely passive, not active at all, for that though other habits may be acquired, faith is infused both for the effence and degree. 2. Man may not be said by his believing to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himself, but to Believe to his Justification, and to receive Justification by believing, for that by faith, as it is Gods work, God doth justifie him,</hi> viz. <hi>declares hereby the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ to be his own; he doth apprehend or receive the Righteousness of Christ by believing, as it is his own act, whereof still he is the Subject, not the Author, as the Bowl is of it running.</hi>

VVHether God concurre Immediately to all humane actions, I have no minde to dispute: If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> want work on that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he may answer <hi>Ludov. a Dola.</hi> But it sufficeth me that man also is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cause of his Believing. 2. Whether man be Passive or not in receiving the habit, is nothing, that I know of, to the matter; as long as the act which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth is immediately by him. 3. It is a great uncertainty which you affirm so confidently. You know not but that the Spirit of God by the Word, may excite an act of faith before he infuse a habit, and by that act (or more) produce a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. 4. And so the habit may be said to be Infused as from God, and acquired by man too: and it is commonly granted, that Infused habits are attained <hi>secundum modum acquisitorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the second Answer, I say, 1. For your Receiving Instrument, we shall speak to it anon. 2. <hi>Si fides efficit Justificationem, tum Credens per fidem ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit Iustificationem: At fides si modò Instrumentum Iustificationis est, Iustificationem efficit: Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> is evident, in that man is the immediate proper Cause of the act, therefore if the act doth it, the Agent by that act doth it. The Instrument is his that immediately and properly useth it. The <hi>minor</hi> is undeniable, speaking of a true instrumental Cause: For there is no instrumental Cause in any kinde, but of efficients.</p>

               <p n="3">3. I perceive also here what you take Justification to be, <hi>viz.</hi> [declaring Christs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135058:69"/> Righteousness to be his own] Right Antinomianism. 1. Will you tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther [Declaring Christs Righteousness to be mine] do not suppose it to be first mine? Else it is the Declaring of an untruth. And if it were mine before, was not I just before? and so <hi>constitutivè</hi> justified? 2. Why did you not tell us when and how that was done? And what was the act whereby God did constitute me just? Which is first to be known, and which you knew that I was speaking of. 3. Where, and to whom is it that [God declares this] you speak of? Onely in Conscience, and not to others, no doubt. But I doubt not fully to shame (in due place) this Antinomian fancy, that Justification by faith (in Scripture sense) is but Justification in Conscience. 4. Many a soul hath justifying faith (of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Consent) who yet doth not believe that Christs Righteousness is their own. 5. May not other Graces declare Christs Righteousness to be ours? (I know not whether it be <hi>sano sensu</hi> that you speak of Christs Righteousness being made ours, but I will not digresse to enquire further into it now.) 6. You do strangely affirm, that man is not the author of his own act (whether he be the subject, I referre to what is said:) If by the Author, you mean, not the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the Agent, the vital, voluntary self-determiner, then he is the Author; or else I could tell you of such unavoidable consequents, as you will be ashamed to own. If you be indeed one of those that think man a free Agent, is no more the author of his own acts, then your Bowl is, I shall fear, lest you will think your self very excusable for all the evil you do, and therefore little care what you do: I shall be loath to trust a man of such principles, if his carnal interest carry him to do me a mischief.

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>ANd whereas he saith, Fourthly, The Instrument hath an Influx on the effect, by a proper Causality, which who dare say of faith? I answer, 1. That it hath a proper Causality upon our Justification passively taken, that is, upon our Receiving the Righteousness of Christ. And no more need: for we make it an Instrument not to work, but to receive. But secondly, according to him it hath more then the Influx of an Instrumental, that of the principal efficient upon our Justification, as being that which makes this Conditional Grant in the Covenant to become Absolute: And all the benefit we receive by the Covenant is more to be ascribed to our faith, then Gods grace in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which would have been of no advantage to us at all, had it not been that our faith came in and rendred it of use to us. Thus then we do not deprive God of his Glory in justifying us by faith, though we ascribe Justification to faith; for we ascribe our faith to God, and make our believing his work, which as it comes from him is an active declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in us a Passive resenting of his favour to us in Christ, of which we alwayes may though we not actually assure our selves.</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. REceiving is either Properly, which is alwayes Passive: Or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, morally, imputatively, which is the Consent of the will when a thing is offered, and it is active, called Receiving, because it is necessary to the Passive proper Receiving.</p>
               <p>In the former sense, to Receive pardon and Justification is nothing but to be pardoned and justified: it is a meer Relative Reception. In the later sense, faith it self is our [Receiving] If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> mean the former, when he saith, that [faith hath a proper Causality upon it] I say, His words are scarce sense. To have [Causality upon] implieth a subject upon which there may be such Causality: But the Reception of a Relation is no such capable Subject. If he mean only [a Causality of that Reception] I say, There is no natural proper Cause of the Reception of a Relation, but that which causeth the Relation it self, by Causing its foundation: though there may be other Causes of the fitness of the Subject, yet that fitness effecteth not the Reeeption. Moral Causes there may be besides; but this is not pleaded such. An efficient Instrument of the Reception of a Relation, (that is, <hi>Justitiae, vel juris ad impunitatem</hi>) we shall believe it to be when we first finde sense, and then truth in that assertion. 2. And for the second kinde of <hi>Receiving</hi> Christs Righteousnesse, it is Faith it self. And to say, that faith hath a proper Causality on it self, is a hard saying.</p>
               <p>Your second Answer is the meer repetition of a notorious slander, not onely unproved, but bewraying the grosse mistake of the Nature of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Condition; as I have sufficiently shewed, and will not waste time to recite.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore contrary to your Conclusion, that if you make faith the proper Instrument of justifying, you make man his own pardoner, and rob God of his Soveraignty. Your reason to the contrary is such as the Papists bring to excuse their doctrine of Merit: they say, Christ hath Merited for them a power of Meriting, and so the glory redounds to him: so you say, [We ascribe our faith to God, though we ascribe Justification to faith.] But you must needs ascribe it also immediatly to your self, if you be the man that believes.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:135058:70"/>
               <p>Again, you touch the way of Gods justifying darkly: [As it comes from him (you say) it is an active declaration, as in us a Passive resenting his favour to us in Christ.] But, 1. do you mean, it is a Declaration Enunciative? Or meerly signal? If the former, it is very false. To speak a Truth, and to Cause one to believe it, are not all one. If the later, then it seems you think God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies a man, every time he giveth him any Evidence of his Grace. And if so, then other Graces justifie as well as faith; and then Justification is increased upon every increase of every Grace: But more of this when you come to it of purpose.</p>
               <p>And Passive Resenting Gods Love or Favour is an ill description of justifying faith, and not a little dangerous.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> K. Mr. Baxter <hi>proceeds to take off an Objection.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. LEt it be observed that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> takes it for needlesse, to say, Faith is a Passive Instrument: and therefore he must maintain it to be an Active Instrument, or none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I doubt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> would have thought me near to a Blasphemer (supposing the interest of his Cause to have carried him another way) if I had said and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that mans Faith doth help the Action of God: 1. If Gods Action were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be <hi>Causa partialis</hi> (which I think Mr. <hi>K.</hi> doth not believe it to be) yet mans Action would help to produce the Effect, only by concurring with Gods Action, but not properly, help Gods Action; for it would have no influx into it. 2. If Gods Action be <hi>Causa totalis in suo genere,</hi> and mans Action subordinate to it, much lesse can mans Action be said properly to help Gods action. 3. But the truth is in pardoning sin, and justifying us, Mans action of believing is no Cause at all, and therefore no proper Help to Gods action. God hath no need of our help to pardon our sin. The performing of our Condition by Thankfull Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christ and Life, is no Helping Gods Action. But its strange to see how Mr. <hi>K.</hi> reels too and fro!

Doth this act ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by suffering? Or can wise men have a grosser conceit then this?] I answer that this Act is equivalent to suffering, as consisting chiefly in a reliance on Christs righteousnesse, without exalting our thoughts against it, captivating our thoughts to it, renouncing all thoughts of our own righteousness, yea all thoughts that are too apt to rise against it from the consideration of our own righteousness; howbeit for the</hi> form <hi>it be an action, yet</hi> virtually <hi>this action is a suffering our selves to be led by the Spirit of God, and by his Authority against the suggestions of our own reason.</hi>

If you have a minde to call this <hi>Passio Reputativa vel Moralis,</hi> I will not contend with you: it being <hi>Conditio activa ad Receptionem propriam requisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> Doubtless the Reliance and Renunciation which you mention, are actions. 3. And where you say, that it is [<hi>Virtually</hi> a suffering our selves to be led by the Spirit, though it be an action for the form] I never heard before of an Action immanent which was <hi>virtually</hi> suffering: and that from such a Cause as Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is: Sure it is somewhat more then such a suffering; and therefore it is new Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to say, that it is <hi>Virtually</hi> suffering. Though as I said, if you have a minde to call it a Moral or Reputative Passion, I will not contend. 4. But then what a suffering is that you imagine it? I thought you would have come nearer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and have said that it is <hi>Receptio Christi, vel Justitiae donatae:</hi> but you say, It is a suffering our selves to be led by Gods Spirit and authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now I come to the great business, I finde you as mute as a fish: You had another Assertion to prove, [that this Act doth by suffering Effect our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:] On this lay all the controversie: and of this I finde not a word. I pray you remember by the next to satisfie your Reader, that [this Act which is Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually a suffering our selves to be led by Gods Spirit, and by his Authority against the suggestion of our own Reason, doth by that suffering effect our pardon or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.] Nay, I thought if you had made it but a Receiving instrument, as you phrase it, that it had been the Receiving Christ or Righteousness, and not the suffering our selves to be led by Gods Spirit and Authority against the suggestions of reason, which (<hi>qua talis</hi>) would have been affirmed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of our Justification?

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> VVHether this merry Rhetorical Triumph were grounded on such a reall victory as the man dreams of, or whether premises and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion be any other then a meer Rapsody of windy ostentation, I must leave to the judgement of the impartial, understanding Reader. I confess they shew that he is not only unreasonable; for <hi>ridere</hi> is proper to a Reasonable Creature. I had thought to have given a particular answer to each passage in this Paragraph, but upon review I finde that the Replying to such like, hath occasioned more iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and sharp passages then I dare approve; and therefore I think it best to say nothing to it, only to reminde him of these few things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I will be none of his adversary, where he argues only to prove me ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. It never came into my head to make it the Question, whether Mr. <hi>K.</hi> or I were the more wise or learned man? I have much more ignorance then he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That yet I dare contend with him in point of veracity, if he use to do with others, as he doth with me, particularly to talk of [making <hi>utramque paginam</hi>] and to scorn at it no less then twelve times in five or six leaves, for my citing these Authours once or twice, and <hi>Schibler</hi> thrice in a whole book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all is not Divinity that such Theologues maintain: For I think he is not Theology in the Abstract: and therefore its possible to finde an errour in such a man as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> without Schooling or beating Divinity: Nor do I think that sound Theology would feel it, though he had a knock or two more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he proves out of <hi>Keckerman,</hi> or others such like, that two and two is four, doth not much abuse Divinity by it: Nor he that cites them to shew that all efficiency is by Action, though as learned a man as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> deny it. Nor do I finde Mr. <hi>K.</hi> having recourse to the Bible to prove the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is efficiency without Action. And I think the Scripture Texts may be soon numbred by which he attempts to prove Faith to be the instrumental Cause of Justification.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. HE hath one Question more [But though Faith be not the Instrument of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, may it not be called the Instrument of Receiving Christ who Justifies us? I do not (saith he) stick so much at this speech as at the former (we are beholden to you: some indulgence yet in this particular) Yet is it no proper or fit expression neither. For, 1. the Act of Faith which is it that justifieth is our Actual Receiving of Christ, and therefore cannot be the Instrument of Receiving. To say our Receiving is the Instrument of our Receiving, is a bard saying.] Be the act of Faith the actual Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ: Why I wonder may not faith be said to be the Instrument of Receiving Christ? Is faith only an Act? I had thought it had been an Habit? And though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving be not the Instrument of Receiving Christ, as being the actual receiving of him; yet faith may very well be so called: as though my receiving of a book be not the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of receiving it, yet the hand may without any great absurdity be allowed that name.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. I Argued, that if faith be the Instrument of Receiving Christ, then either the Act of faith, or the Habit: but neither the Act nor Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To prove that the act of faith is not the instrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ, I used the words that he here cites. What doth this Learned man but confute this by saying, that the Habit is the Instrument? [I had thought (saith he) faith had been a Habit.] Thus he confutes me, who argue that the Act is not the Instrument, by saying that the Habit is. I think he that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> need not much lament that he lost the benefit of such a disputants tutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, if he be never in a more waking mood then here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Rhetorick is the best part of his answer. But when will he prove that the Habit of faith so farre differs from the act, and both from the soul, as that the Habit may as truly or fitly be called the instrument of Believing or Receiving, as the Hand is of its Act or the effect? If his similitude would prove any thing it would rather be that the Faculty is the Instrument, then that the Habit is: which yet I finde him not here attempt: I think that the Habit of faith, and the act are not of so different natures as is the Hand and its act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it still be remembred, that I do not much regard how this Question is determined (for which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> doth so humbly tell me, he is beholden,) it being much different from the former Question. For in the former, the term [Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] is taken properly for an instrumental efficient Cause, in which sense I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that faith justifieth: But here it is taken Metaphorically or Vulgarly, and not properly: For that which effecteth not is not an instrumental efficient Cause. And that which they call an Instrument of Receiving, is in Naturals but <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio materiae,</hi> and in Morals, but <hi>Dispositio Moralis, vel Reputativa, vel Actus ad Receptionem passivam, propri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m, veram necessarius;</hi> and in our present case, strictly nothing: but a Condition. Now if any will be pleased to speak so vulgarly and improperly, as to call such a Condition, or Aptitude Moral or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral [an Instrument of Receiving] so he do not build any unsound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon it, I do again professe that I will not contend with him. But the Reasons why I thought it necessary for all that, to contradict the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faiths being the Instrument of Justification, I have fully manifested in answer to other Brethren.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>BƲt secondly, saith Mr.</hi> Baxter [<hi>The seed or Habit of faith cannot fitly be called an Instrument, 1.

Who ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Habits or Dispositions the souls Instruments? The Aptitude of a Cause to produce its effect, cannot be called, The Instrument of it. You may as well call a mans Life the Instrument of Acting, or the sharpness of the knife, the knives Instrument, as to call our Holinesse or Habitual faith, the Instrument of Receiving Christ.] I answer, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by certain steps, and to deny the Habit of faith to be the Instrument of Receiving
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135058:73"/> Christ, you say, 1. The sanctified faculty it self cannot be the Instrument. And 1. What if it cannot? Who reckons the Habit of faith for a sanctified faculty? This is that which sanctifies the faculties: The faculty is of one</hi> Species <hi>of quality,</hi> potentia naturalis; <hi>faith which sanctifies of another,</hi> habitus. <hi>You are, it seems, now and then out in your Logick, as much as you trouble us with it, and had need review your</hi> Burgers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius <hi>and</hi> Keckerman. 2. <hi>How prove you that the sanctified faculty is the soul it self, In stead of the few Names you muster up, I may bring you thousands that are against it: and yet a few Reasons weigh more then all these great Names. If the faculty be the same with the soul, then the Holinesse of the faculty cannot be really distinct from the soul, for that this Holiness is to be received into the faculties; and if no faculty be really distinct from the soul, then is there no receiving into it any thing really distinct from the soul, and if Holinesse be not Really distinct from the soul, a holy soul, and an unholy one, are not Really distinct, and so you seem to imply in your second, when you say</hi>—</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> yieldeth, if I am able to understand him, that the Act of faith is not the Instrument of Receiving Christ: and he layes it on the Habit. Before we proceed here observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Generality of Divines that plead for faiths instrumentality, say, that it is not the Habit, but the Act of faith that justifieth: (I said so too when I wrote my Aphorisms, taking it on trust, but I now recant it.) If that be so, then they cannot (as they do) argue thus: [Faith is the Instrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ and his Righteousness: Therefore faith justifieth as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] because they speak of the Habit in the Antecedent, and of the act in the Consequent; and so by [faith] mean not in both the same thing: and so there are <hi>quatuor termini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Observe, that it is commonly granted, that the Habit of faith is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in act: as in sleep, and when we are wholly taken up with thoughts of an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene subject, and all the time of Infancy (according to them that think Infants have the Habit of faith.) This being so, it must needs follow, that faith is not alwayes the Instrument of Receiving Christ, and of Justifying: (nay perhaps, but seldome comparatively) For the Causality of the Instrument is in Action, and faith is not alwayes acting. If therefore faith justifie as an Instrument, and we are alway justified, and yet faith be not alway an Instrument, then either we are not justified by faith, but some other way, at those times when faith acteth not, or else <hi>cessante Causâ non cessat effectus:</hi> which though in some cases it may be true, yet here it cannot: because the effect being but a <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> a transcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Relation, it hath no nearest Cause, but its Foundation and Subject: and when those cease the Relation ceaseth: And none affirmeth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cause of Receiving Christ, that is, Right to Christ (with his benefits,) And if it were, yet the <hi>Fundamentum Relationis</hi> must have the sustentation of a continued Cause. But in the way that I affirm faith to justifie, as a moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only (having no Causality) all these inconveniences, or rather contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are avoided: For it being the meer will of the Donor, that createth the nearest necessity of the Condition, and so requires the Condition to such an end, he may make either act or Habit the Condition, and may make the act the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Beginning our Right to Christ and Life, and the Habit continued, to be the Condition of continuing that Right, even when the act is intermitted:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135058:74"/> and yet the effect may still continue, because the Will of the Donor, and the Law or Covenant which is his Instrument, do both continue; and it is they that are the efficient Causes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Observe also, that both the man for whom Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is here so zealous, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emble,</hi> and many more, do make the Habit of faith to be nothing else, but our New Life, our Holiness of the renewed faculties, the Spirit of God in us, and that all Graces are in the Habit and seed but one, and so accordingly it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it is our internal Sanctification or Holiness that is the Instrument of our Justification: A Doctrine that I think these men will scarce own upon consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Observe also, that hence it will follow, that it is other graces that justifie instrumentally as well as faith: because they say, it is the Habit that is the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and this Habit is but one: not one Habit of faith, and another of Love, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all one: and this one Habit justifies, even when men are Infants, or asleep, and do not act.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That which is now commonly called, the Habit of Grace, is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called, [the Spirit in us:] and so the holy Ghost is made our instrument of Justification.</p>

                  <hi>K</hi>'s words here. In the words of mine which he cites, I do both indirectly, or <hi>in transitu</hi> confute a third opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the sanctified facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are the Instrument, though the sanctity of the faculties be not: and directly I argue <hi>à forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re,</hi> that if the sanctified Faculties themselves may not properly be called the Instrument of Receiving Christ, much lesse can the sanctity of the faculties be so called: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this too learned man feigns me to think, or say, or imply, the Habit of faith to be a sanctified faculty; and with seeming seriousness fals a schooling me, and tels me, that [the faculty is of one <hi>Species</hi> of quality, and faith of another;] yea proceeds in his dream as confidently as if he were waking, to tell me, that I [am now and then out in my Logick, and had need to review my <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> and <hi>Keck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman.</hi>] But would he a little rub his eyes, I would desire him to tell his Reader, where I did directly or indirectly say, that Faith is a sanctified faculty? And I would know of him, whether a man should not understand a matter before he make an answer to it!</p>
               <p>Next, it seems, he expected I should have proved, that the faculty is the soul it self: And would not that have been as wise a Digression, and as Necessary, as is this of his? The Scope of my words was but this, <hi>q. d.</hi> [It is a controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doubtful point, Whether the Faculties are distinct from the soul, as <hi>Res &amp; Res,</hi> and therefore not fit to bear such a weight as those that I oppose do lay upon the affirmative] (and my own opinion inclineth to the Negative: yet so as I dare not be so presumptuous as confidently to interpose among so many learned men, and maintain my own opinion as certain truth.) As wise a man as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (and in my opinion an eight at least above him) thought the like answer to be good in another case. <hi>Davenant. Determ. Qu 37. pag. 166.

               <p>For the few names that he tels me I muster up, its like he may know that it were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135058:74"/> easie to give him a farre larger muster roll, especially of the Scotists. And as for the thousands that he saith he may bring against it (no doubt he means Writers) I confess plainly, that he hath so farre lost his credit with me, that I do not believe him. For though I know they are many, yet I do not think he hath read many thousands on all sides of that Subject. But if he have indeed read so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand books of that one point, alas, how many hath he read in all? No wonder if poor <hi>Burgersdicius, Schibler</hi> or <hi>Suarez</hi> be despised by him. It may be that's the reason that both the margin and Text of his book are so naked of quotations; he having read so many thousands that he knew not which to preferre, or where to beginne; or else would have few mens names to his Works but his own (except as Adversaries) lest they should share of the honour. Nay, if he should have said or meant, that there are thousands that so write, which others have read though he have not, I doubt he cannot prove it true.</p>
               <p>For his great weighing Reasons, I will honour them as soon as I can see them, but he had little Reason to expect me to Reason that Case. If this that he next addes be one of his few Reasons, that weigh so much, I must tell him, Every man to his minde. I doubt he overvalues his own Reasons: For my part, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand great Names, yea one, will weigh as much with me, as this his Reason. For, 1. I deny his Consequence, and say, that the Holiness may be Really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the soul, though the faculties are not; and that Holiness may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inhere in the soul without the mediation of faculties really distinct from it. It had been easie to have seen the necessity of giving some answer to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. As wise a man as most we have (if I conjecture not amiss) and a publick Professour in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and now resident where Mr. K. had his Chait, I mean Mr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> saith thus: [And so, however it may be true, that a faculty or natural Power may be so far the same with the soul, as that it differ only <hi>ratione ratiocinatâ,</hi> yet in a Habit we must of necessity grant a distinction <hi>ex parte rei:</hi> For where there may be a real separation, and not only mental, there must needs be granted a distinction <hi>in re.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But what if I grant Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s hardest Conclusion that Holiness is not Really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the soul, nor a holy soul from an unholy as [Really] is taken for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction <hi>inter Rem &amp; Rem.</hi> We shall see anon what danger would be in it. But then Mr. K. must be so honest, as not to perswade any that I therefore deny a Real distinction, as [Real] is opposed to feigned, mental, called <hi>Rationis,</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Denominative.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. SAy you [Who ever called Habits or Dispositions the souls Instruments?

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. IF Habits were never so properiy to be called the souls instruments, yet this reacheth not the Question, whether they may properly be called (<hi>Logicè loquendo</hi>) instruments of Receiving when they are not instruments Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting. I did therefore give them too much advantage in this arguing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you grant that acquired Habits are not to be called the souls instruments▪ and yet maintain that infused are, you must give some good reason from the difference.</p>
               <p>Your reason is that [This is a Habit, but equivalent to a new faculty.] To which I Reply, 1. What reason is this? When I even now said, That [the sanctified faculty it self cannot be the Instrument] you never did gainsay it: therefore if faith were a faculty or <hi>Potentia,</hi> it were not therefore the instrument of Reception.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The term [equivalent] is so ambiguou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that you may yet make your words true or false by an interpretation. 1. If you mean that infused Habits are of the same nature, and of the same <hi>species</hi> of quality, as the <hi>Potentia naturalis</hi> is, that should have been well proved, and not nakedly asserted. 2. If you mean that it performeth the same kinde of operations, and <hi>quoad usum</hi> is equivalent, though not of the same nature or kinde; that also needs great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oof, seeing it contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth common principles: The operation of things is such as the Being. 3. If you mean but that it is of equal necessity to the Act, thats nothing to the purpose; for the necessity proves it not an instrument.</p>
               <p>But I conceive the first of the three is your sense, or else I cannot make sense of it; for the two later do no way tend to prove it an Instrument; and your words do most plainly import that sense. But, if so 1. Sure you forgot your own words but a little before, where you were pleased so farre to School me, as to tell me that [the faculty is of one <hi>species</hi> of quality, <hi>Potentia naturalis,</hi> faith which sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of another, <hi>habitus.</hi>] And you gravely told me, I was now and then out in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135058:76"/> my Logick, and demanded of me, Who reckons the Habit of faith for a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Faculty? 2. How can you say still that it is a Habit? For if it be truly a Habit, it must be of the same <hi>species</hi> of quality, as Habit; and admit the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Habit, and therefore not admit the definition of <hi>Potentia</hi> or <hi>Facultas,</hi> nor be of that <hi>species:</hi> and I suppose you will not say it is of both, and be but one Quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cite not these, as owning them; but to shew Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that as learned men as he, have not the same thoughts of Habits, and therefore he should not be too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily confident: And I confess, as highly as I think of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s learning, I do not think he truly and clearly knows what a Habit of the soul is, nor wherein it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the soul, the faculties, and the act, and the intelligible <hi>species:</hi> no nor a wiser man then himself neither. Every man knows not so much as he boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, or thinks he knoweth. (And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow likely then he is to know so much of God as he here pretendeth to, we may easily judge.) It was as wise a man as he that said [<hi>Nam quomodo intellectu Deum caput homo, qui ipsum intellectum suum▪ quo eum vult capere, nondum capit?</hi> August. <hi>de Trinitat. li. 5. cap.</hi> 1.]</p>
               <p n="3">3.

But this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But those words do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly signifie in Scripture, only new Inclinations, Dispositions, Qualifications. It is a new heart, though only the old faculties and substance. I hope you will not follow <hi>Illyricus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Where you say that [without faith a man can no more Receive Christ, nor do ought towards it, then a dead man can walk or speak.] I Reply 1. That proves not faith to be equivalent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Potentia vel facultas,</hi> any otherwise then that it is of as absolute necessity, but not that it is of the same nature. If you shew an illiterate man a Greek or Hebrew book, he can no more reade in it then a dead man, that is, both are truly <hi>in sensu composito</hi> impossible: But yet it is but a habit that is wanting to one, and a power or faculty natural, to the other. And so it may truly be said that a sinner cannot do well that hath accustomed to do evil, no more then a Leopard can change his spots, or a Blackmoore his skin. Yet if you mean that such are equally distant from an actual change as a dead man, it is but a dead comparison. A dead man wants both natural faculties, and an inclination or moral power. An unbeliever wants but one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That [without faith, such can no more do ought towards the receiving of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135058:77"/> Christ, then a dead man can walk or speak] is a dead doctrine, like the rest of Antinomianism, tending to licentiousness, and to subvert the precepts of the Gospel, and the salvation of men, and unfit for any man that shall use the Name of Christ, much more unfit for a Divine. The Ranting sect hath got the word too: and when they are reproved for wickedness, or perswaded to duty, they say, [<hi>What can the creature do?</hi>] To go out of an Alehouse or Whorehouse, and to go to hear the Gospel preached, is somewhat <hi>towards</hi> receiving Christ: for faith comes by hearing; and can no man do this without faith? Cannot the Eunuch reade a Chapter and ask help of an Interpreter without faith? Cannot men Fast and Pray, if not as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> yet as <hi>Ahab,</hi> without faith? Is there not a common Grace of the Spirit, drawing men <hi>towards Christ</hi> that were farre from him, which goes before the special Grace (at least sometimes) whereby they are drawn <hi>to Christ?</hi> This that you maintain is not the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joh. Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolton, Perkins,</hi> or any of our experimental practical Divines; no nor of any Protestants that I know; I am sure not of the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi> but of the Libertines and Antinomists. To what end do you preach to any unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? Do you perswade to any means or duty towards the getting of faith? or do you not? If not, its like you Preach as you Dispute; and then I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you live at <hi>Blisland:</hi> If you do, sure that duty tends to faith, and may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I think you do more boldly assert, then you can solidly prove that [without faith a man can no more receive Christ, then a dead man walk] if you mean it of the Habit of faith, as, no doubt, you do. If you should mean it of the Act, it were a merry arguing: <hi>q. d.</hi> [We cannot Receive Christ without Receiving him: therefore Receiving him is a Power, and so an Instrument] Actual faith, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual moral Receiving Christ. But I suppose you mean it of the Habit, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to your former Dispute; And then you suppose that God cannot cause the Act of faith by his Spirit, before the Habit, and by the first act cause a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit (as <hi>Camero</hi> taught, and his followers do still teach.) I suppose if the question were put but <hi>de facto,</hi> Whether God do ordinarily thus cause faith? it is past Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s power to prove the Negative: Much more if the question be <hi>de potentia divina,</hi> whether God <hi>can</hi> do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where you say [It gives life to the soul in regard of all spiritual operations.] I Reply, 1. How industriously doth Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> prove that faith is not the Mother grace? not properly the root of all other graces, nor the first degree of our sanctification and spiritual life, either in the Habit or the Act: <hi>Vindic. Grat. pag.</hi> 12, 13, 14. Yet Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that is so zealous in defending him, sticks not to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Knowledge and Love may be said to give life to the soul, if the exciting and assisting other graces, be giving life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is in effecting or receiving a relation (<hi>Jus ad Christum, impunitatem, salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>) that we are enquiring after faiths Instrumentality. And you do turn the business to [giving Life to the soul in regard of spiritual operations;] whereby you seem to mean that faith is no otherwise an Instrument of receiving Christ, then as it is an Instrument of every other operation which it performeth; and as every other habit of grace (Love, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are instruments of their acts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You play with the ambiguity of the term [Life.] You take it for the Union of Causes. You know how commonly it is used for the <hi>Forma Viventis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:135058:77"/>5. And so faith is, as <hi>Pemble</hi> saith, part of the souls new life, that is, new spiritual Rectitude; or as others, the whole <hi>semen vel principium.</hi> But this is only a formall, and not an efficient quickening, or giving life. And if you speak of faith exciting other graces: 1. That it doth by the Act, which you yet affirm not to be an Instrument. 2. So do all graces in their places help the rest.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If you did prove that Habits are fitly called the souls instruments in producing the Acts, yet it is all nothing to our business. For we are enquiring how farre it is the Instrument of the effect, or of reception. And I still say, that where the Act is no efficient cause, there the Habit by causing the act, is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the effect. But in our Justification, the act of faith is no efficient cause (Justification is the immediate effect of God by the Act of grace now, and by his Sentence hereafter.) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for reception, I say it hath no instrument, but as the instrument of the effect, may be called its instrument; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will speak as a Mechanick, a Rhetorician, or <hi>Vulgariter,</hi> and not Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically. And when Mr. <hi>K.</hi> gives me cogent Reasons against this, I hope I shall regard them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>K. VVHereas you adde lastly, [The sharpness of the knife cannot be called the knives Instrument.] I must without disparagement to your confest acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in other things, tell you, that this is but a dull instance: for faith is not as the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but as the knife; and faith admits sometime a greater sharpness, sometimes a less, which qualifies it in its acting better or worse, more or less.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. I Acknowledge the instance of little use to the main Question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it pertains but to the Act of faith, and not the following passion or effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The sharpness of your Answer, serves but to cut your own fingers. That faith is as the knife, is feigned, and not proved. The knife is the substance, and the keenness is the accident or <hi>modus.</hi> Faith is not a substance, but a <hi>modus</hi> or accident of the soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your large sense, you may say <hi>quid vis ferè de quovis,</hi> and so I told you J did not contradict you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. J am so censorious as to imagine that you speak more by rote, then on true knowledge in your Physicks, about site; but thats no matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Who doubts but the soul may, in the sense you mention, be said [to act by faith in receiving?] But once more distinguish of receiving: which is 1. The act of consenting to, or accepting of the offer of Christ and Life; which is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio Ethica,</hi> metaphorically called Reception. 2. The true passive reception of Right to Christ and Life, which follows on the former. The first is but the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135058:78"/> Condition, and not the Cause of the late, and is in Morality to the later, as in Naturals the <hi>Dispositio materiae</hi> is to the Reception of the form: but the efficient Cause of the later Reception is Gods Will, signified by his Law; and his Law signifying his Will, and Constituting the Duness. Now if you will say, that Faith in the Habit is the instrumental efficient Cause of the first Receiving Christ, that is no more then to say, the Habit is the instrumental Cause of the Act, <hi>viz.</hi> its own Assent and Consent: as Love may be said of its Act. And whether this Speech be proper or improper, J leave it to your self, J will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. But for all Faith might be called the instrument of Believing (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it may) and that Believing is tropically called Receiving, yet I deny that it can therefore be properly called the Instrument of consequent, proper, Passive Reception of Right to Christ. (The Passion is such as Relations in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception are capable of.) Yet improperly, vulgarly, as an Instrument is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an Efficient Cause, I did profess and still do, that I will contend with none that will call Faith the Instrument of Receiving (or any Consent of the Will, call it Love, or what you will▪ as well as Belief in Christ, may so be call'd an Instrument.) But that Faith is no true Instrumental Cause of forgiving our sins, or Justifying us, I shall yet maintain till I see stronger Reasons then M. <hi>K.</hi> hath here produced; and to that I am moved upon Reasons of great weight, which I have elswhere manifested.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> speaks too unlimitedly [of the Impossibility of Receiving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Christ without Faith.] I dare say, that many a thousand (if not all men) have received Benefit by Christ before faith. What say you by the Gospel? What say you by Faith it self? J hope it is not the Instrument of our Receiving it self? Yea, and it is more then Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can prove, That God could not if he would, have given pardon it self to some without faith, upon Christs meer Satisfaction. But what need I talk of this, to a man that thinks we have so much of, or towards Remission, Justification, Acceptation before faith, as he before disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted for, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be tantamount Justified? Though he takes them to be from Eternity, and so no fruits of Christs Death, yet he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but as to us, we are as capable of Receiving such Benefits, without faith, from Christ, as without Christ.</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. I Think your first Conclusion (that you have done little by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute) hath as cogent Evidence, as most that you have maintained in these six leaves. But it had been more wisdom to have foreseen your loss of time, and to have prevented it, rather then to confess it to your disgrace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where you say, you [had not patience] I say, If you cannot forbear, there's no remedy: who can hold that which will away? The tongue is an unruly member. Perhaps your case is as his <hi>Discollimin.</hi> p. 54.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I dare not excuse, much lesse justifie my tongue or Pen, from too sharp and unmannerly speeches of my betters: Even where I discern no fault, I do suspect some, as knowing so much evil in that heart which is the fountain: And I hope all those pious Brethren whom I shall injure by my rashness, will heartily forgive it; which I earnestly request, and by Gods assistance, shall do the like by others. But yet I must needs say, that my Conscience doth not accuse me of [handling unworthily] D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

That I had been by them ensnared in some of them, and thought my self bound to warn others of the danger. 2. The name of such worthy men may do more in propagating an errour, then a thousand unlearned Antinomians can do, and therefore should their mistakes be more diligently disclosed. 3. It is pity Gods gifts and Saints should be a Defensative to errour, and a snare to the Church. 4. I am confident the souls of these two Saints of God, if they know these things below, will give Mr. <hi>K.</hi> no thanks for his Vindication, nor be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me for disclosing their mistakes, which they now do farre more detest then I. 5. It was no such Crime in the late Reverend As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Had I been my self the Authour of Dr. <hi>Twisses</hi> Works (pardon the presumption of the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition) I should say ten times more against several things in them, then I ever yet did. 7.

I intreat the impartial Reader to peruse my words themselves, and then let him judge as he seeth Cause. They are but these [A great Question it is, Whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Justification be Immanent or Transient acts of God: The mistake of this one point was it that led those two most excellent famous Divines Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> to that errour and Pillar of Antinomianism, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification from Eternity. For saith D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>K.</hi> durst not once say that I falsly accused them; or that it was not their errour. And could I give them a higher Elogy, then to call them [most Excellent, Famous Divines.] I am confident the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Archbishops or Cardinals, yea the Pope himself would think such Titles no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:135058:79"/> way injurious to them. The Lord General will be content with lower Titles then [most Excellent and Famous] Do not such as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> go about to confirm the vile reproaches of the times, as if Ministers were the most intollerably proud men on earth, when this is taken for unworthy handling! And when they that expect that their hearers should bear their sharpest and frequent reproofs, cannot bear such an honourable mention of their mistakes?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether there be one true word in Mr. K's particular accusation [as if they had need to be taught a Logick lesson of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>] I am content my very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies should Judge. Did I ever contend about any point of Logick with them? It was not, what an immanent Act is? But onely, Whether Justification be an Immanent Act, and so Eternal, that I enquired, and in which I opposed them? I do therefore take it as my duty to Admonish my learned Brother of his great sin, who hath not once, twice, or thrice, but so oft in six leaves spoken such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable untruths in matter of fact, and made so little Conscience of the ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If in this Paragraph Mr. <hi>K.</hi> do discover the very end of his undertaking, not to be so much the Vindicating of any truth of God, but of Worthy Divines, and Academicall Honour (of which I leave the Reader to Judge) then may we hence conjecture at the Reason of severall Passages through the whole: for the Means may not be better then the End; and no wonder if they be suited to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for all that follows concerning my [being scarce bred in either Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I have nothing to say. Did Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ever hear me contend for the Reputation of being Learned? He easily carries the Cause here, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And where he saith, that [somewhat more of the University would have done me no harm] I do not believe him: For though I have been as sensible of my want of such happy opportunities, and my defects thereupon, as ever Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was, at least; yet I believe that all things work together for Good to them that love God; and that by that three-fold Cord (on my Friends, Body, and scrupulous Conscience) by which God restrained me from such advantages, and confined me to a more private course of studies, he did also restrain me from some evil that I might else have run upon, or prevent some that he saw would befall me: (and indeed he hath satisfied me now of the particulars.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. What men or other creatures those were that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did [hear boast of me to the disparagement of both Universities] J cannot conjecture. But this J will promise Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that how little soever J have received from the Universities, they shall have my frequent and earnest prayers to God, and my best endeavours with men, for their Prosperity. The Lord purge them from Pride, Sensuality, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing and Self-seeking, and cause them humbly to study Christ above all, and zealously to lay out themselves for his Glory, and with considerate, resolved Self-denial and Unreservedness, wholly to resign themselves to his service, and make it their main business to win souls to that true felicity which they have first tasted of themselves; and then J should not so much fear any policy or power of their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And for Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s concluding Poetical injunction; J heartily confess my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unworthiness to be annumerated to the Ambassadours of the Lord Jusus, or ever to have been permitted to speak in his Name; much more with any such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and encouragement as he hath vouchsafed me: And the Lord forbid that ever
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135058:79"/> I should be so arrogant, as to equal my self with the Worthies of the Church, much lesse to envy the honour of their preheminence. Yet in regard of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches present necessities, I dare not give over, for all my imperfections. Though I have ever been of a spirit too easily discouraged, and have many a time been under <hi>Jonas</hi>'s temptation, and ready to say as <hi>Jeremy, I will speak no more in his Name;</hi> yet God hath so suited his providences to my infirmities and necessities, as not only to cure my backwardnesse and despondency, but also to convince me of the pleasantness of his work. I am assured that it was the Lord that sent me into his Vineyard, and without him none shall force me out. He that gave me fewer Talents then others, will expect but an answerable improvement at my hands: but be they never so small, I dare not hide them. He that calleth for two mites will accept them: He despiseth not the day of small things. He some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time revealeth that to babes which he hideth from the wise and prudent: For the wisdome of the world is foolishness with God, and the foolishness of God is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then men: and no flesh shall Glory in his sight. How many learned men have lost the main end of their Learning, and engaged God so farre against them, as to lay both them and their honour in the dust, because they would not devote it more faithfully to his service! The Lord grant that I may so use the small abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I have, that I be not condemned as an unprofitable and unfaithfull servant▪ and then I do not fear being condemned for their smalness. There are many learneder men then Mr. <hi>K.</hi> in hell; and many more unlearned then I in heaven.</p>
               <p>But should I deny my self to be Vile against the Accusations of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> when I daily confess my self Vile to God, I should but prove the hypocrisie of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And therefore Dispute for Reputation that will for me. When I am tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to such a work by Accusers, or by my own heart, I desire God to save me from the Temptation. He that works principally for himself, must be his own Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>THe summe of all that hath been hitherto said in this Paragraph, is this, That to Justification there is required a transtent act of Gods, or the working of Faith in our heart; which shews, That albeit Gods Decree to Justifie us have much in it that looks so well like Justification, that it may be called so without Blasphemy, yet that indeed Justification is in time, not from Eternity: And it appears further thus: That Justification being the Absolving us from our sins, and the Accepting us as righteous, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God the Father Decreed it, the Son Purchased it, a Grant of it were made, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Seal; yet till it be pleaded there is no Pardoning; as appears by comparing Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with that of Princes, which is not of Value till Pleaded, and not pleaded till after the Jury hath found the Offendor Guilty: so this Justification which begins at our Believing</hi> in foro Conscientiae, <hi>a more private Sessions is again made more Publick in Heaven at our death, and this at Gods Bar before Angels and Saints deceased; and yet more publick before all the world at the General Judgement. This pardon was Purchased, Resolved, or Issued out, Sealed, Received, Pleaded at first: but as new sins are committed we plead it again, and so may be said to be particularly Justified from particular sins,</hi> toties quoties, <hi>but alwayes by virtue of our General Pardon.</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> VVE are now past the End, and yet new to begin. If in this Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection he had not stumbled on a word or two, that come from the Core of his Errour, I should scarce have understood any of his minde about the Controversie in hand, save only Negatively, and that he is against Me. And yet it is not much that I can discern of it. Among all the Disserters of all Sects that ever I had to do with, that pretended to Learning, I have seldome met with the like slippery dealing, as in Mr. <hi>K.</hi> who pretending to make some notable discovery of the Truth, did so lose himself in the eager pursute of a contemptible Adversary, that he seems to have quite forgot his undertaking, and leave his errand behinde him. But to deal truly, it is my opinion, that though the man were drawn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himself, yet when he had emptied his bilious stomack, he found his work done, and therefore was willing to drop asleep when he should have performed his Promise. He doth over and over again promise us to open to us <hi>what is the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient Justifying Act,</hi> yea, <hi>pag.</hi> 139. to <hi>speak Punctually to it;</hi> and when all's done, the business is so farre undone, that for my part, I cannot certainly tell yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he once name it, or what his opinion about it is. <hi>Pag.</hi> 141. He saith [by Giving us saith, he Justifies us, as shall be shewed anon, he giving us that which is our Instrument, whereby we receive the Righteousness of Christ.] That [anon] is not yet come; for I finde no fuller discovery of his minde, but only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little glance in this Recollection, wherewith he doth conclude. In those former words he seems to make the Immediate Justifying act to be the Giving of Faith; and yet contradicts it in the next words; for that Faith he makes to be Given, that it may be our Instrument of Receiving. Now</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are enquiring after Gods act, and not mans Instrument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are enquiring after the Immediate effecting Act, and not a Receiving, which is no effecting.</p>
               <p>Let us see whether these words under consideration will any better discover his sense.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He saith [that to Justification there is required a Transient Act of Gods; or the working of faith in our heart] This is all the transient Act I can learn he intends from first to last. But though before he said [by Giving us faith, he Justifies us] yet here he thought it safer to speak more ambiguously, and onely saith, that [this is required to Justification.] But there are many things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it, besides that Act which doth immediately Effect it: Antecedents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the Causes of those Conditions, are all Required to it; when yet none of them is <hi>the</hi> justifying Act. But if indeed he do mean that <hi>Fidem dare,</hi> is <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificare,</hi> I will speak to that anon. Next he saith, that [Gods Decree to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, looks well like Justification] but that is not it. Next he saith, that [Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is the Absolving us from our sins, and Accepting us as Righteous] that he may come to shew us what is not, and what is, the Absolving and Accepting Act. And first again he excludes <hi>Decreeing</hi> from being the Act enquired after: then he excludes Christs Purchase; then he excludes the Grant made and sealed: then he saith [Till it be pleaded there is no pardoning, as appears by comparing Gods pardon with that of Princes.] Perhaps then he means that [Pleading] is Pardoning, or the justifying Act. No, not so neither: For he only saith, that till it be Pleaded, there is no Pardoning] which plainly expresseth, That Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135058:80"/> is but a prerequisite Condition, the want whereof suspendeth the act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but is not the Pardoning act it self. In the Conclusion he gives us a little more light to see part of his meaning, where he saith [so this Justification which begins at our Believing <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> a more private Sessions, is again made more publick in Heaven at our death, and this at Gods Bar before Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Here he tels us more then yet I could gather from him, <hi>in quo foro justificamur fide,</hi> that it is but <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> a more private Sessions, so that we are left to search for the justifying Act; which though he vouchsafe not expresly to mention, yet we may possibly conjecture at by this last passage. If the Reader would see the whole mystery which is thus darkly lapt up, as being somewhat afraid of the light, as far as I can gather, it is this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>K.</hi> being of the Antinomian faith, That Remission and Justification are Immanent Acts, and from Eternity (and consequently not purchased by Christs bloud) and that Justification by faith, which the Scripture speaks of, is only Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> or the apprehension of the former; he thought, in these times, when Antinomianism hath an ill savour with the best, that it is the wisest way to appropriate the name of Remission and Justification by faith (in this life) to this Justification <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> and to give to the Immanent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Act, the description without the name. And therefore he thought it fittest to say, that [Gods decreeing to Remit our sins, carries in it a Remission of them tantamount; for who shall charge them on us, where God decrees to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them?] <hi>Pag.</hi> 138. That [Gods Decree to passe the transient Act of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, carries in it as much as concerns Gods Remission of sins, and Acceptance of us as Righteous.] But the change that is made in time by the transient Act, is in our Feeling or Knowledge, and therefore he saith, that when we say [Now a man is justified in Gods sight] it [signifies only a testimony given by God, whereby he makes <hi>us</hi> know that we are justified before God, or in his sight] and that [in God it signifies, A making us to see: and we are said to be justified in his sight, when he makes it, as it were evident to our sight, that we are justified] <hi>p.</hi> 138. (Here before he was aware, he gives it the name of justification before we see it.) Now being Resolved to appropriate the name of Remission and Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (in this life) to that which is <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> he is hard put to it, to deliver his meaning of the transient justifying Act, without opening the shame of his opinion. And therefore sometimes he saith, It is the Giving of saith to be our Instrument: Sometime that this faith is necessary to it: but concludes, that it is <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> a private Sessions, that we are justified before death: So that the Summe is this: That Iustification, and Remission, and Acceptation do consist in our Conscience's apprehension or feeling of that which God did from Eternity (which must not be called Remission, but Tantamount Remission:) and because Conscience cannot know or feel this, but by Believing, and because we cannot Believe till God give us the Grace of faith, therefore God justifies or pardons us by Giving us that Grace: that is, We by Believing or being Conscious of our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acceptance, do immediately justifie and forgive our selves; but mediately God forgiveth and justifieth us by Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sing us to Believe, and Causing our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to justifie us immediately.</p>
               <p>I will not say, that I am certain I have hit of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s minde in this explication: for who can be certain in such a mist? And therefore I leave every Reader that thinks I mistake it, to gather it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He confesseth that we are pardoned as Offendors are by a Prince's pardon, which is not of Value till pleaded. Now let any man of understanding judge, whether the Princes Pardon Granted and Sealed, be not the immediate, efficient Cause of this Delinquents absolution or passive pardon, when he doth plead it: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not first a <hi>Jus impunitatis</hi> that is hereby Given him, which (whatever is here said) is of Value upon the Accepting, before the pleading, though the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is also necessary to stop judgement, or prevent Execution, and so to have the full benefit. And what though the Pardon Granted and Sealed be not Effectual till Accepted or Pleaded? Doth it follow, that it is not the immediate Cause af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? Let it not seem unmannerly if I speak my thoughts; that all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this Learned mans great mistake or inconsiderateness of the Nature of Laws and their Actions, and of the nature and use of Conditions, whose <hi>non</hi>-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance doth suspend the action of the Law or Grant, (because the Will of the Legislator or Donor was, that it should so be) but the performance doth not cause its action, much less immediatly cause the Effect; unless there be something in it that may work as a procatarcktick efficient Cause, by way of Merit, or the like, over and above its meer Office of a Condition.

                  <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> that we are first justified on our Believing, then the immediate justifying Act (which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath talked so oft of) can be no other then either our own Apprehension, or belief that we are Pardoned and Righteous, or some such like Apprehension or Conclusion of our own hearts. For if it be <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> it must be By Conscience as the Agent, that is, By the understandings Concluding us to be what we are▪ But this both supposeth us to be Pardoned and Righteous before (for the Being of a thing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the true Knowledge that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>:) and also it makes us to pardon and justifie our selves; and the transient justifying Act of God, so long enquired after, should be only Gods cooperating with us in our Believing, or Causing us to Believe. Yea rather, the Act of justifying faith (which is the Acceptance of an offered Christ and Life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11▪ 12.) goes before this Act now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this is but Assurance or a Consciousness of the State that by Believing we are in. Let any man that is willing to know the truth, but examine every Text
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135058:81"/> of Scripture that speak of Justification by faith, and he may easily see that they do not (no not one of them) speak of Justification in <hi>foro Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ienciae,</hi> or of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of our Righteousness, but of Justification before God.</p>
               <p>And that Gods giving faith is not the immediate justifying act, appears 1. From the very name. [To give faith] is one thing, and [to justifie] i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> another. 2. From the real difference. Faith is given by a Physical act imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: Righteousness, immediatly by a Legal or Moral act. Faith is a real Quality (in the habit) or Act: Righteousness is a Relation, and is immediatly by a meer Resultancy. Nay the very matter or meritorious cause of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness now in question, is not faith, but Christs satisfaction and merits. The <hi>terminus</hi> therefore of the justifying act (J speak now of our constitutive▪ Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is Righteousness, a Relation: but the <hi>terminus</hi> of Gods act in giving Faith, is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Faith so given. The Object also of the justifying act, and the Subject of Justification, is <hi>credens,</hi> a man already Believing: but the object of that act which giveth faith, is an Unbeliever. 3. Is not this flat Popery? to make Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to lye in a real change, and not a relative? and so to make it the same with Vocation, Conversion, Regeneration, or Sanctification? Whereas the holy Ghost saith, [<hi>Whom he called them he justified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30.] For to give faith is Vocation (as those Divines say, that make faith to go before other graces in habit and act:) or it is Vocation, Regeneration and Sanctification, as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> thinks, who supposeth all infused <hi>in uno semine.</hi> So that if <hi>Fidem dare,</hi> and <hi>Justificare</hi> be all one, then to Justifie and to Call or Sanctifie is all one.</p>
               <p>I had once thought to have heaped up divers Arguments here in the conclusion on these two last points. 1. To prove that our first Justification by faith, which Scripture speaks of, is not <hi>in foro conscienciae.</hi> 2. To prove that [to give faith] is not the proper or immediate justifying act of God. But I shall forbear 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>K.</hi> gives me so little invitation to it, seeing he gives but a few dark hints of his own minde. 2. In that I finde upon review that almost all this paper is unavoidably taken up with a meer defence of my words against his injury, and he hath not given me occasion for many further profitable explications or disputes: and therefore I will reserve these for a fitter place. 3. Because I have larglier al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Argued against both these in private answers to the Animadversions of learned Friends: and though those are not for publique view, yet I have a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to the doing of one thing so oft. 4. Because this little that I have here said, seems enough, and proportionable to his brevity which doth occasion it.</p>
               <p>This one thing seems necessary, in the Conclusion, that I adde a few Reasons to prove that it is in Law-sense that we are first justified by faith, and so that the Moral Act of the Law is the immediate justifying act (and consequently the enacting of that Law of grace, or granting that Deed of gift, is the next foregoing efficient act.) There are Reasons enough in my Aphorismes, but Mr. <hi>K.</hi> thought it easiest to take no notice of them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When I say [Justified in Law] I do not mean [by the Law] strictly taken as most do, for one only <hi>Species</hi> of Law: But I mean [by Law] in general, as it is truly defined to be <hi>Constitutiva Determinatio Rectoris de Debito.

               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>A natura Sententiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Declarative sentential Justification or Pardon, presupposeth Justification Constitutive. Therefore Justification Constitutive goes before sentential Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Here I suppose 1. That Constitutive is <hi>per Legem,</hi> and not <hi>per Sententiam,</hi> which is past dispute. 2. That it is by faith (as the condition) that we are justified <hi>Constitutivè,</hi> it being only Believers that are Morally qualified to be fit subjects for this Justification, and whom alone the new Law pronounceth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to whom alone it effectually giveth Christ and Life. The Antecedent is plain, in that the Judge must sentence a man to be as he is, and according to his Cause. A man must be just, before he justly be pronounced▪ Just. He that condemneth the Righteous, and he that justifieth the wicked, they both are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord, <hi>Prov. 17. 15. He that saith to the wicked, Thou art Righteous, him shall Nations curse, people shall abhorre him▪</hi> Prov. 24. 24. So that whether the sentence be in conscience or Heaven, it must presuppose Justification Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive.</p>
               <p>Arg. 5. <hi>A natura fidei Justificantis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the nature of that act of faith which justifieth, be only such as may be the condition of the Laws constitutive Justification, and not such as may be the Instrument of sentencing us Just, then Justification by faith (which Scripture mentioneth so oft) is Justification in Law sense, and not Sentential: But the Antecedent is true; as is proved from the Act, which I have elsewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be [the Accepting of an offered Christ and Life] (including Assent) and not the Antinomian, special Belief that we are pardoned, or a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods special Love to us, or a consciousness of our Righteousness, or Assurance of it, which are said to justifie sententially <hi>in foro Conscientiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arg. 6. <hi>A communi consensu, &amp; usu loquendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the common judgement of men to think, and common custom to say,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:135058:82"/> that [A King pardoneth by his written, or verbal Pardon, as his Instrument] and to distinguish [<hi>Justificationem Legis] a Justificatione Judicis,</hi> the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presupposed: therefore we must do so here, unless any special reason can be brought against it: For Gods Law hath the common nature of a Law, and his Judgement the common nature of judgement.</p>
               <p>To prove the Antecedent I need but to appeal to the common use of men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Legal and Judicial affairs. Yea even Mr. <hi>K.</hi> himself cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear acknowledging it: Yea besides the forementioned acknowledgements, he is strangely guided to conclude with it, as the very last word of his Digression, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me [We may be said to be particularly justified from particular sins <hi>toties quoties,</hi> but alwaies by vertue of our general pardon.] This general pardon is that which God issued out and sealed as he saith, which becoming effectual when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived▪ and pleaded, doth by its virtue justifie us from particular sins: that is, by its moral or civil action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. When the Scripture so oft denieth Justification by the Law, it plainly implieth that there is such a thing <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> as Justification by a Law, and that it is no improper unfit speech: For else God would not use it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. &amp; 3. 11. Yea it opposeth Justification by grace in Christ, to Justification by the Law, <hi>Act. 13. 39. By him all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses:</hi> Where note the opposition that [by Christ and Grace] is opposed to [by works] and so [by the Law of Christ and Grace] is opposed to [by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and Works.] That therefore is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the Law of Grace, which is denied of the Law of Works: <hi>viz.</hi> to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And the reason why the Law of Works could not justifie, was for that it was weak through the flesh, and not that it was an action or effect disagreeable to the nature of a Law.</p>
               <p>Many other actions of Law to the same purpose, I recited out of several Scriptures, in my Aphorismes, <hi>pag.</hi> 178, 179. which I will not trouble the Reader to repeat.</p>

               <p>ANd thus I have done that ungratefull work which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was pleased by Digressing to put me upon: which I confess appears not lovely to me on the review. For I finde though I have easily born the charges of this Learned man, yet it is no very usefull work to the Reader that he hath here called me to; and I thought it not fit to go beyond my call. In the first part I have little to do, but to obtrude his confidence, and to shew that he meerly feigned me his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, forgetting that of <hi>Seneca, Victoriae sine adversario brevis est laus:</hi> In the rest I have not much to do, but to open the vanity and fallacy of many words, and to shew what a windy Triumph it is which followeth such a windy Opposition, and what his Reader oweth him, who doth <hi>importare verba &amp; sonum pro mercibus:</hi> And what can the Reader gain also by such a discovery. I finde also, that though I resolved to forbear all harsh language when I begun, that I have not satisfied my self in the performance. For when I came to his most injurious words, I could not tell how to answer them but by shewing plainly what they are, and calling a Spade, a Spade; which cannot be done in smooth and pleasing words; and I finde that I have used more Ironies then I dare approve of. My resolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, to stifle this work till I have a call to publish it, and then to commit it to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:135058:83"/> some moderate hand, to correct all that shall seem too unmannerly. For though I think I have spoken nothing but what Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ought to hear, yet I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not more then was fit for me to speak. It is my purpose therefore to deal with him no more, lest I be drawn again to the same inconvenience. For I finde I cannot Reply to such a man in such termes as I do to the Moderate and Candide. Till his breath be sweeter or sounder I think it safest to stand further from him. When he disgorgeth his stomack on me, I have not the skill of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it off so mannerly, and cleansing my self without his disgrace, as I could wish I had. And if a man stirre them not very tenderly, <hi>Plus faetent stercora mota.</hi> I finde also that it is a very hard thing against the guilty to speak both truly and pleasingly: For <hi>nemini blanditur Veritas:</hi> and I have a natural inclination to speak nakedly and plainly; which being seconded with some degree of opinion, that <hi>qui loquitur planè, loquitur sanè,</hi> may quickly occasion me to step too farre. But the principal cause is, that I am truly aweary of the Warres of Divines: Many an opportunity and importunity have I put by, as finding here also, that <hi>Impendia belli sunt praemiis majora:</hi> and especially in this civil uncivil Warre of Brethren, the gainer usually loseth: unless men could be brought to deal more with the <hi>Matter,</hi> and less with <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> Contentions are both the Daughter and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pride.

But what I do in way of Controversie, yea even when necessitated, so that I dare not forbear, least I should betray or wrong the Truth, yet is it grievous and ungratefull to me: I have little pleasure in it. I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therefore to draw back from this work, as much as I finde consistent with my Fidelity to the Truth of Christ; and to do nothing in it till I am satisfied of a Call that must not be resisted. And when I follow God, I may safely commit to him my Way and Labours: for I have found that he draweth forth nothing, which he knows not how to use for good. And the more any Brother is perswaded that I transgress my bounds in writing too sharply, I intreat him the more to pray for the pardon of my fault, and the more watchfully to shun the like himself; and to joyn with me, and all the Churches friends, in daily and importunate requests to God, that he would guide our feet into the way of Truth and Peace; even of that Truth, which lying between extreams, is the only way to stedfast Peace; and of that Peace, which is the Means and End of Truth. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> I Have been willing to hope that my work of this kinde, and with this kinde of men, was almost at an end, and that God would in mercy grant me some little vacancy for more profitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors (of practicall Theology) which I have long affected, and earnestly desired an opportunity to perform: But the uncessant assaults of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious men do make me begin to lay aside such hopes; The enemy of truth is too subtle for me; It's like he doth conjecture at the shortness of my time, and therefore contriveth to force me upon other works till my glasse is run. I have long foreseen his plot, and yet I am not able to disappoint him: To quiet the spirits of the contentious is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my power; To bear in silence their Reproaches of my self, and to spend but little time or none in vindicating of any Interest of mine own, this I have purposed and promised to my Brethren. But when I see apparently that it is an interest higher then mine that is assaulted, and that Gods Truth and the souls of men do command my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for their defence, I have no power to forbear. Since the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Book, there is come to my hands a second Volume of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

               <hi>John Goodwin</hi> on the point of perseverance; wherein he hath assaulted my <hi>Directions for Peace of Conscience</hi> in a large Preface; and my Book of <hi>Rest,</hi> in a Digression: Had he fallen on my <hi>Aphorismes</hi> again, I think I should have silently yeelded them up as a sacrifice to his scorn; But those other Practicall Writings, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it my duty justly to defend. 1. Because I know it is the Serpents malicious design to make my Labours unprofitable to the Church. And seeing God in great mercy hath satisfied me by experience, that how weak soever, they have been hitherto successfull, I take it for no proud over valuing them, but for a judgement upon experience, to conclude that it will be some wrong to the Church of God and souls of men if I silently give way to this serpentine design. 2. I have heard such Jealousies and terrible accusations spread abroad by this sort of Divines against my Writings, and especially my <hi>Directions for Peace,</hi> as caused me much to admire what the cause of the offence should be. Never could I hear but one particular accusation of it, which is the shamelesse falshood, that I was against the doctrine of the <hi>Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance;</hi> to which I annexed an Apology to the second Edition. But I found it was further buz'd into the heads of the people, that there were many other dangerous errors in it; But all was in generals, and I could never learn any of the particulars till now: Nay the people that were deterred from reading it, knew none of the particulars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but took on trust from jealous fame that such there were. And I learned, that there is among some Brethren of this strain, a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:135058:84"/> by raising such reports to deterre the people from the reading of my writings. I confess, upon all this I was not much sorry for the event, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K.</hi> had in this book brought forth his accusations, that at last I might know my errors that I could never hear of before, &amp; that was at last put into a capacity of making my defence; when if it had not been for this man I might have still been judged erroneous, &amp; neither I nor those that believed and reported it, could with all our diligence have learned <hi>wherein;</hi> I understand that the same spirit doth sometime carry this learned man into the Pulpit, and there instigate him to the like em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, wherewith he once tickled or netled the ears of the Auditory at <hi>Aldermanbury.</hi> Truly I never thought my name, or description, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be brought into a Pulpit, though in a way of opposition. I thought none had thus over-honoured me but M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Tombs,</hi> nor durst I think my name capable of being the matter of so honorable a triumph to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K.</hi> as by the diligence he useth for a victory he seemeth to expect. But seeing he hath so much advantage of the ground (and somtime the winde, though not the Sun) when he manfully preacheth against me at a hundred miles distance; I must give him the better there, and take him when he comes within my reach. And though I shall be as be as brief as I can, yet so much I intend, if God vouchsafe me time and ability, as shall shew you reason to pity this Learned man, that ever his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should lay him open to the prevalency of those temptations which have ingaged him in so unhappy a design as to serve the enemy of truth in employing his excellent parts in false accusing and unjust defaming his brother that would fain live in peace, endeavouring to deprive mens souls of the benefit of his labors, and that in his mercenary serving the lusts of another, for a little vain-glory of applause he should so wound his Reputation with the sober and godly, and make such work for an accusing conscience, as he hath once and again done; yea, that he should still so much neglect the 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Command. as to become M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Eyres</hi> second, and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Crandons</hi> third. And for those Reverend Brethren, who have (from several parts) solicited me to forbear further Controversal debates, lest I be deprived of opportunity for more profitable works (whereto they importune me) I profess to them that I take it for the greatest affliction of my life, that I am necessitated to this defensive controversal way of writing, &amp; most gladly would I be at peace, if men would give me leave; and if they will but convince me, that I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be silent where the Truth of God, the success of all my former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and the good of men is so nearly concerned, I shall resolve on si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; (For my own interest I hope I can subject it to Christs;) But till then I must crave their pardon, yea, and their compassion of me, who am to my great trouble detained from a more pleasing kinde of work.</p>
